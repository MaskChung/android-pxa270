There are two ways to build mtd from CVS code

1. Inside the kernel tree

Get the source from CVS. Invoke patchkernel.sh from the top directory.
You have at least to supply the directory of the kernel you want to
patch. Command line options for various patch selections are available.
Invoke the script without arguments for help.
The script works for kernels >= 2.6 and can be used to prepare 
pristine kernels and update your already mtd-patched kernel to the
latest state of the art.
Depending on your kernel version, which is retrieved from the kernel 
Makefile, some modifications and a bunch of softlinks are brought into your
kernel source.
Go back to your kernel directory and invoke make as usual. No 
restrictions are given, if you want to have the drivers linked 
into your kernel or built as modules.

2. Outside the kernel tree

Get the source from CVS. Modify Makefile in the MTD top directory to
match your kernel directory. This requires a kernel source, which 
has the approriate config switches and some mtd patches set already 
(see below). Invoke make from here. This can build module based stuff only.

Don't wack me if it failes. I never did it this way :)

Enjoy.
