    <h1>JFFS2 & erase block size</h1>

    <P>Unlike the original JFFS, JFFS2 treats each erase block of the
    flash separately. It will never write nodes which cross from one
    erase block to another, and will not cope if it encounters a file
    system with such nodes. Any node which crosses an erase block
    boundary will be ignored by JFFS2, and the data it contains will
    be lost, causing the file system to be corrupted. If there's not
    enough space at the end of the current erase block to write a whole
    node, JFFS2 will leave it blank and continue writing to a new
    erase block. Also, JFFS2 always starts writing at the beginning
    of an erase block, and does not expect to find free space in the
    middle. Any free space in an erase block should go all the way to
    the end of the erase block.

    <P>One more thing to know is that JFFS2 may use multiple physical
    erasable blocks as one (virtual) eraseblock if the flash partition
    size is large enough. This implies that if one of physical blocks
    within the JFFS2 eraseblock becomes bad, the whole JFFS2 eraseblock
    is regarded as bad, thus wasting one or more good physical
    eraseblocks. Albeit this is a drawback, it makes the eraseblocks
    accounting very simple.</P>
