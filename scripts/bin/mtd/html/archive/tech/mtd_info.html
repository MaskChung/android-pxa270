    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;char name[32];</TT></H2>

    Name of the device. Rarely used, but presented to the user via the

#define MTD_CLEAR_BITS          1       // Bits can be cleared (flash)

    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;loff_t size; </TT></H2>

    Total size in bytes.

    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;u_long erasesize;</TT></H2>

    Size in bytes of the &quot;erase block&quot; of this memory device - the
    smallest area which can be erased in a single erase command.

    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;u_long oobblock; </TT></H2>
    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;u_long oobsize;</TT></H2>

    Some memory technologies support <I>out-of-band</I> data - for example,
    NAND flash has 16 extra bytes per 512-byte page, for error correction
    or metadata. <TT>oobsize</TT> and <TT>oobblock</TT> hold the size of each
    out-of-band area, and the number of bytes of &quot;real&quot; memory with
    which each is associated, respectively. As an example, NAND flash, would
    have <TT>oobblock == 512</TT> and <TT>oobsize == 16</TT> to show that
    it has 16 bytes of OOB data per 512 bytes of flash.

    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;u_long ecctype;</TT></H2>
    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;u_long eccsize;</TT></H2>
    
    Some hardware not only allows access to flash or similar devices, but
    also has ECC (error correction) capabilities built-in to the interface.
    The <TT>ecctype</TT> field is an enumeration - currently you have a 
    choice of:
    <PRE>
#define MTD_ECC_NONE            0       // No automatic ECC available
#define MTD_ECC_RS_DiskOnChip   1       // Automatic ECC on DiskOnChip
    </PRE>
    The <TT>eccsize</TT> holds the size of the blocks on which the hardware
    can perform automatic ECC.
    
    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;struct module *module;</TT></H2>
    
    <P>When a driver is a kernel loadable module, this field is a pointer to
    the <TT>struct module</TT> of the module. It is used to increase and 
    decrease the module's usage count as appropriate.</P>
    
    <P>The <I>user</I> modules are responsible for increasing and 
      decreasing the usage count of the driver as appropriate, for 
      example by calling <TT>__MOD_INC_USE_COUNT(mtd->module);</TT> in 
      their <TT>open</TT> routine.</P>

    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;int (*erase) (struct mtd_info *mtd, struct erase_info *instr);</TT></H2>

    <P>This routine adds a <TT>struct erase_info</TT> to the erase queue for 
    the device. This routine may sleep until the erase had finished, or
    it may simply queue the request and return immediately.</P>
    
    <P>The <TT>struct erase_info</TT> contains a pointer to a callback function
    which will be called by the <I>driver</I> module when the erase has
    completed.</P>
    
    <P>For more information, see the <A HREF="erase.html">erase</A> page.</P>

    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;int (*point) (struct mtd_info *mtd, loff_t from, size_t len, u_char **mtdbuf);</TT></H2>
    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;void (*unpoint) (struct mtd_info *mtd, u_char * addr);</TT></H2>
    For devices which are entirely memory-mapped and which can be mapped 
    directly into user-space page tables, we may support execute-in-place
    (XIP) mapping of data on the flash. The precise semantics of this are
    yet to be defined, so it's probably best just not to either implement
    or attempt to use these two functions right at the moment.

         <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;int (*read) (struct mtd_info *mtd, loff_t from, size_t len, u_char *buf);</TT></H2>
         <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;int (*write) (struct mtd_info *mtd, loff_t to, size_t len, const u_char *buf);</TT></H2>

    <P>Read and write functions for the memory device. These may sleep, 
      and should not be called from IRQ context or with locks held. </P>
    <P>The <TT>buf</TT> 
      argument is assumed to be in kernel-space. If you need to copy to 
      userspace, either use a <TT>kiobuf</TT> to lock down the pages first,
      or use a bounce buffer.</P>
    
    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;int (*read_ecc) (struct mtd_info *mtd, loff_t from, size_t len, u_char *buf, u_char *eccbuf);</TT></H2>
    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;int (*write_ecc) (struct mtd_info *mtd, loff_t to, size_t len, const u_char *buf, u_char *eccbuf);</TT></H2>
    
    <P>For devices which support automatic ECC generation or checking, these
      routines behave just the same at the read/write functions above, but
      with the addition that the <TT>write_ecc</TT> function places the 
      generated ECC data into <TT>eccbuf</TT>, and the <TT>read_ecc</TT>
      function verifies the ECC data and attempts to correct any errors which 
      it detects.</P>

         <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;int (*read_oob) (struct mtd_info *mtd, loff_t from, size_t len, u_char *buf);</TT></H2>
         <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;int (*write_oob) (struct mtd_info *mtd, loff_t to, size_t len, const u_char *buf);</TT></H2>
        
    <P>For devices which have out-of-band data, these functions provide 
      access to it.</P>
    <P>The <TT>from</TT>/<TT>to</TT> address is the address of the 
      <EM>start</EM> of the real page of memory with which the OOB data
      is associated, added to the offset within the OOB block.</P>
    <P>Example: To specify the 5th byte of the OOB data associated with the
      NAND flash page at 0x1000 in the device, you would pass address 0x1005
    </P>

    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;void (*sync) (struct mtd_info *mtd);</TT></H2>

    <P>This routine will sleep until all pending flash operations have 
      completed.</P>
    
    <H2><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;void *priv;</TT></H2>

    This is used for data private to the MTD driver.

<H3><TT>};</TT></H3>

<HR>
<H1>Notes</H1>
    <P>All the MTD driver functions may be sleep. You may not call any of them
      from an IRQ or timer context, or with locks held. </P>
    <P>Nothing may modify the data in the <TT>struct mtd_info</TT> after
      it is registered with the MTD system.</P>
    <P>The <TT>read</TT>, <TT>write</TT> and <TT>erase</TT> routines are
      mandatory. Also <TT>read_oob</TT> and <TT>write_oob</TT> if the MTD
      device indicates that it has such capability.</P>
    <P>The <TT>sync</TT> routine is <EM>not</EM> mandatory, and users should
      check that the vector is non-NULL before attempting to use it.</P>
