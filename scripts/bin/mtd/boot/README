Bios Extension Flash Boot

This code implements a small IPL structured as a bios extension that can be
placed in the upper address space an be executed by a system bios to perform a
kernel load directly from flash.

The loader portions were taken from the etherboot package and the flash
stuff from the MTD layer. All the code is covered by the GNU General Public
License version 2 or greater.
