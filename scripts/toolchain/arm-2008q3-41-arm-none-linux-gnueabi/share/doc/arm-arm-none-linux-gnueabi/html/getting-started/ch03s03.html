    </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id298849"></a>Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2008q3-41</h3></div></div></div><p><b>Definition of <span class="type">va_list</span>. </b>
          In order to conform to the ABI for the ARM Architecture, the
	  definition of the type of <span class="type">va_list</span> (defined in
	  <code class="filename">stdarg.h</code>) has been
	  changed.  This change impacts only the mangled names of C++
	  entities.  For example, the mangled name of a C++ function
	  taking an argument of type <span class="type">va_list</span>, or
	  <span class="type">va_list *</span>, or another type involving
	  <span class="type">va_list</span> has changed.  Since this is an
	  incompatible change, you must recompile and relink any
	  modules defining or using affected
	  <span class="type">va_list</span>-typed entities.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 assembler fixes. </b>
	  The Thumb-2 encodings of <code class="code">QADD</code>,
	  <code class="code">QDADD</code>, <code class="code">QSUB</code>, and
	  <code class="code">QDSUB</code> have been corrected.  Previous versions
	  of the assembler generated incorrect object files for these
	  instructions.  The assembler now accepts the
	  <code class="code">ORN</code>, <code class="code">QASX</code>, <code class="code">QSAX</code>,
	  <code class="code">RRX</code>, <code class="code">SHASX</code>, <code class="code">SHSAX</code>,
	  <code class="code">SSAX</code>, <code class="code">USAX</code>, <code class="code">UHASX</code>,
	  <code class="code">UQSAX</code>, and <code class="code">USAX</code> mnemonics.  The
	  assembler now detects and issues errors for invalid uses of
	  register 13 (the stack pointer) and register 15 (the program
	  counter) in many instructions.
        </p><p><b>Printing casted values in GDB. </b>
	  A GDB bug that caused incorrect output for expressions
	  containing casts, such as in the
	  <code class="literal">print *(Type *)ptr</code> command, has been fixed.
	</p><p><b>Bug fix for objcopy/strip. </b>
          An objcopy bug that corrupted COMDAT groups when creating new
	  binaries has been fixed.  This bug also affected
	  <span><strong class="command">strip -g</strong></span>.
        </p><p><b>
	  Improved support for debugging <span class="trademark">
	  RealView</span>® objects
	. </b>
	  GDB support for programs compiled by the ARM <span class="trademark">RealView</span>® compiler has been
	  improved.
	</p><p><b>Binutils support for DWARF Version 3. </b>
	  The <span><strong class="command">addr2line</strong></span> command now supports
	  binaries containing DWARF 3 debugging information.  The
	  <span><strong class="command">ld</strong></span> command can display error messages
	  with source locations for input files containing DWARF 3
	  debugging information.
	</p><p><b>NEON improvements. </b>
          Several improvements and bug fixes have been made to the
          NEON Advanced SIMD Extension support in GCC.  A problem that
          caused the autovectorizer to fail in some circumstances has
          been fixed.  Also, many of the intrinsics available via the
          <code class="filename">arm_neon.h</code> header file
          now have improved error checking for out-of-bounds arguments,
          and the <code class="code">vget_lane</code> intrinsics that return signed
          values now produce improved code.
        </p><p><b>NEON compiler fix. </b>
	  A compiler bug that resulted in incorrect NEON code being
	  generated has been fixed.  Typically the incorrect code
	  occurred when NEON intrinsics were used inside small
	  <code class="code">if</code> statements.
        </p><p><b>Connecting to the target using a pipe. </b>
	  A bug in GDB's
	  <span><strong class="command">target remote | <em class="replaceable"><code>program</code></em></strong></span>
	  command has been fixed.  When launching the specified
	  <em class="replaceable"><code>program</code></em> failed, the bug caused
	  GDB to crash, hang, or give a message
	  <code class="literal">Error: No Error</code>.
	  
	  
	</p><p><b>Mixed-case NEON register aliases. </b>
	  An assembler bug that prevented NEON register aliases from being
	  created with mixed-case names using the <code class="code">.dn</code> and
	  <code class="code">.qn</code> directives has been fixed.  Previously only
	  aliases created with all-lowercase or all-uppercase names
	  worked correctly.
	</p><p><b>Janus 2CC support. </b>
          GCC now includes a work-around for a hardware bug in Avalent
	  Janus 2CC cores.  To compile and link for these cores, use
	  the <code class="option">-mfix-janus-2cc</code> compiler option.  If
	  you are using the linker directly use the
          <code class="option">--fix-janus-2cc</code> linker option.
        </p><p><b>ARM exception handling bug fix. </b>
	  A bug in the runtime library has been fixed that formerly
	  caused throwing an unexpected exception in C++ to crash
	  instead of calling the unexpected exception handler.  The
	  bug only affected C++ code compiled by non-GNU compilers
	  such as ARM <span class="trademark">RealView</span>®.
	</p><p><b>Mangling of NEON type names. </b>
	  A bug in the algorithm used by the C++ compiler for mangling
	  the names of NEON types, such as <span class="type">int8x16_t</span>, has
	  been fixed.  These mangled names are used internally in
	  object files to encode type information in addition to the
	  programmer-visible names of the C++ variables and functions.
	  The new mangled name encoding is more compact and conforms
	  to the ARM C++ ABI.
        </p><p><b>Errors after loading the debugged program. </b>
          An intermittent GDB bug has been fixed.  The bug could cause
	  a GDB internal error or an IDE timeout message after the
	  <span><strong class="command">load</strong></span> command.
        </p><p><b>Half-precision floating point. </b>
          Sourcery G++ now includes support for half-precision floating point
          via the <span class="type">__fp16</span> type in C and C++.  The compiler can
          generate code using either hardware support or library routines.
          
          For more information, see <a href="ch03s02.html#sec-arm-fp16" title="Half-Precision Floating Point">the section called &#8220;Half-Precision Floating Point&#8221;</a>.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id299323"></a>Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2008q3-13</h3></div></div></div><p><b>GDB update. </b>
	  The included version of GDB has been updated to
	  6.8.50.20080821.  This update adds numerous bug fixes and
	  new features, including support for decimal floating point,
	  <span>improved Thumb mode
	  support,</span> the new <span><strong class="command">find</strong></span> command to
	  search memory, the new <code class="option">/m</code> (mixed
	  source and assembly) option to the
	  <span><strong class="command">disassemble</strong></span> command, and the new
	  <span><strong class="command">macro define</strong></span> command to define C
	  preprocessor macros interactively.
        </p><p><b>Uppercase operands to IT instructions. </b>
	  The assembler now accepts both uppercase and lowercase operands
	  for the <code class="code">IT</code> family of instructions.
        </p><p><b>NEON autovectorizer fix. </b>
	  A compiler bug that caused generation of bad <code class="code">VLD1</code>
	  instructions has been fixed. The bug affected code compiled with
	  <code class="option">-mfpu=neon -ftree-vectorize</code>.
        </p><p><b>Remote debugging improvements. </b>
	  The <span><strong class="command">gdbserver</strong></span> utility now supports a more
	  efficient communications protocol that can reduce latency during
	  remote debugging.  The protocol optimizations are enabled
	  automatically when <span><strong class="command">gdbserver</strong></span> operates over
	  a TCP connection.  Refer to the GDB manual for more information.
        </p><p><b>Output files removed on error. </b>
	  When GCC encounters an error, it now consistently removes
	  any incomplete output files that it may have created.
        </p><p><b>ARMv7 offset out of range errors. </b>
	  An assembler bug that resulted in
	  <code class="literal">offset out of range</code> errors when compiling for
	  ARMv7 processors has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 <code class="code">MUL</code> encoding. </b>
          In Thumb-2 mode, the assembler now encodes <code class="code">MUL</code>
          as a 16-bit instruction (rather than as a 32-bit
          instruction) when possible.  This fix results in smaller
	  code, with no loss of performance.
        </p><p><b>ARM C++ ABI utility functions. </b>
          Vector utility functions required by the ARM C++ ABI no
          longer crash when passed null pointers.  The affected
          functions are <code class="function">__aeabi_vec_dtor_cookie</code>,
          <code class="function">__aeabi_vec_delete</code>,
          <code class="function">__aeabi_vec_delete3</code>, and
          <code class="function">__aeabi_vec_delete3_nodtor</code>.  
          <span>
	   In addition, on GNU/Linux systems, the ARM C++ ABI utility
	   functions are now exported from the
	   <code class="filename">libstdc++.so</code> shared library.  
          </span>
	  These functions are not intended for use by application
	  programmers; they are only called by compiler-generated
	  code.  They are not presently used by the GNU C++ compiler,
	  but are used by some other compilers, including ARM's
	  <span class="trademark">RealView</span>®
	  compiler.
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.3.2. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite for ARM GNU/Linux is now based on GCC version 4.3.2.
          For more information about changes from GCC version 4.2 that was
          included in previous releases, see
          <code class="uri">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/changes.html</code>.
        </p><p><b>Smaller Thumb-2 code. </b>
          When optimizing for size (i.e., when <code class="option">-Os</code> is
	  in use), GCC now generates the 16-bit <code class="code">MULS</code>
	  Thumb-2 multiply instruction instead of the 32-bit
	  <code class="code">MUL</code> instruction.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 <code class="code">RBIT</code> encoding. </b>
	  An assembler bug that resulted in incorrect encoding of the
	  Thumb-2 <code class="code">RBIT</code> instruction has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Sprite communication improvements. </b>
	  The Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite now uses a more efficient protocol
	  for communicating with GDB.  This can result in less latency
	  when debugging, especially when running the Sprite on a remote
	  machine over a network connection.
        </p><p><b>Marvell Feroceon compiler bug fix. </b>
	  A bug that caused an internal compiler error when optimizing
	  for Marvell Feroceon CPUs has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Misaligned accesses to packed structures fix. </b>
          A bug that caused GCC to generate misaligned accesses to
          packed structures has been fixed.  
        </p><p><b>Bug fix for objdump on Windows. </b>
          An objdump bug that caused the <code class="option">-S</code> option
          not to work on Windows in some cases has been fixed.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id299961"></a>Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2008q1-126</h3></div></div></div><p><b>Disassembler bug fix. </b>
        A bug in the disassembler has been fixed that formerly caused
        <span><strong class="command">objdump</strong></span> to crash when processing raw binary
        files, or other executables with an empty symbol table.
       </p><p><b>NEON assembler symbols. </b>
	  An assembler bug that caused spurious undefined symbols to be
	  generated has been fixed.  The <code class="code">mov d0, d1</code> instruction
	  would incorrectly cause an undefined symbol <code class="literal">d1</code>
	  to be created.
        </p><p><b>Profiling bug fix. </b>
	  A bug that caused incorrect behavior and crashes when running code
	  compiled for <span><strong class="command">gprof</strong></span> profiling
	  (<code class="option">-pg</code>) has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>GDB <span><strong class="command">info registers</strong></span> crash fix. </b>
          Executing <span><strong class="command">info registers</strong></span> after
          executing <span><strong class="command">flushregs</strong></span> no longer crashes GDB.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id300100"></a>Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2008q1-102</h3></div></div></div><p><b>GDB and <span><strong class="keycap">Ctrl</strong></span>-<span><strong class="keycap">C</strong></span> on Windows
	. </b>
	  GDB no longer crashes when you press
	  <span><strong class="keycap">Ctrl</strong></span>-<span><strong class="keycap">C</strong></span>
	  twice during remote debugging to give up waiting for the target.
        </p><p><b>ARM Cortex-A9 processor support. </b>
	  The compiler can now generate code optimized for the
	  ARM Cortex-A9 processor.  This is enabled by the 
	  the <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-a9</code> command-line option.
        </p><p><b>MOVW and MOVT relocations. </b>
	  A linker error that resulted in incorrect offsets when processing
	  relocations on <code class="code">MOVW</code> and <code class="code">MOVT</code> instructions
	  referencing mergeable string sections has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Improved argument-passing code. </b>
          The compiler can now generate more efficient code for
	  certain functions whose arguments must be sign-extended
	  to conform with language or ABI conventions.
	  The required conversion was formerly being performed both 
          in the called function and at all call sites; now the redundant
	  conversion has been eliminated for functions that can only be 
          called within the compilation unit where they are defined.
        </p><p><b>Multi-process mode for <span><strong class="command">gdbserver</strong></span>. </b>
	  The <span><strong class="command">gdbserver</strong></span> utility has a new command-line option,
	  <code class="option">--multi</code>, that allows you to use it to debug multiple
	  program instances.  Refer to the Debugger manual for more information.
	</p><p><b>GDB <code class="code">qOffsets</code> crash fix. </b>
	  GDB no longer crashes when a remote stub provides load
	  offsets for an unlinked object file.
        </p><p><b>Linker error allocating ELF segments. </b>
          A bug where the linker produces an incorrect error message
          with segments at the top of the address space has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>GCC stack size limit increased. </b>
          On Windows hosts, the maximum stack size for the GCC
          executable has been increased.  This means that more complex
          programs can be compiled.
        </p><p><b>Stack overflows in <code class="function">printf</code>. </b>
          Some stack overflows in <code class="function">printf</code>-family
          functions have been fixed.  These overflows occurred with
          format strings with very large precision values such as
          <code class="code">%1.300000000s</code>, and with some invalid format
          strings.
        </p><p><b>Invalid object file after strip. </b>
	 A bug in the assembler has been fixed that formerly caused
	 <code class="literal">.set <em class="replaceable"><code>symbol</code></em>
	 <em class="replaceable"><code>expression</code></em></code>
	 constructs to emit <em class="replaceable"><code>symbol</code></em> in the
	 wrong section.  This in turn caused inconsistent behavior
	 after stripping the symbol table. 
        </p><p><b>GCC update. </b>
	  The GCC package has been updated to version 4.2.3.  This version
	  includes numerous bug fixes since GCC 4.2.
	</p><p><b>License checking on Linux. </b>
          Sourcery G++'s license-checking logic now includes a workaround 
          for a kernel bug present in some versions of Linux.  This bug 
          formerly caused failures with an error message from the 
          <code class="literal">cs-license</code> component.
        </p><p><b>Cortex-R4F and VFPv3-D16. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ now supports the ARM Cortex-R4F CPU
	  and the VFPv3-D16 floating-point coprocessor.  These can
	  be selected with <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-r4f</code> and
	  <code class="option">-mfpu=vfpv3-d16</code>, respectively.
        </p><p><b>Overlapping operands for long multiply instructions. </b>
	  An incorrect assembler warning has been removed in the case of
	  overlapping source and destination operands for
	  <code class="code">UMULL</code>, <code class="code">SMULL</code>, <code class="code">UMLAL</code>
	  and <code class="code">SMLAL</code> instructions on ARMv6 processors.
        </p><p><b>Size optimization bug. </b>
	  A code generation bug that caused corruption of function
	  arguments when compiling with <code class="option">-Os</code> has been
	  fixed.  The corruption occurred as part of the sibling call
	  optimization.
        </p><p><b>C++ library ABI fix. </b>
          GCC 4.2.1's <code class="code">std::type_info</code> was not fully
          compatible with earlier versions.  The ordering of four
          virtual functions has been fixed in this update.
	</p><p><b>Improved gdbserver thread support. </b>
	  The GNU/Linux remote debug agent,
	  <span><strong class="command">gdbserver</strong></span>, no longer fails when two
	  threads call <code class="function">pthread_create</code> at the same
	  time.  It also supports limited thread debugging when
	  symbols for <code class="filename">libpthread.so</code> are not
	  available.
	</p><p><b>GDB support for user-defined prefixed commands. </b>
	  The GDB <span><strong class="command">define</strong></span> and
	  <span><strong class="command">document</strong></span> commands, which allow you to
	  add new commands to the GDB command-line interface, now
	  support creating commands within an existing prefix
	  such as <span><strong class="command">target</strong></span>.  Hooks for prefixed
	  commands are also supported.  Refer to the Debugger manual
	  for more information.
	</p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
	  The included version of GDB has been updated to
          6.7.20080107.  This update includes numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>UNC pathname bug fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused linker errors on Windows
          hosts when running a Sourcery G++ toolchain installed in a UNC
          path
          (<code class="filename">\\<em class="replaceable"><code>host</code></em>\<em class="replaceable"><code>directory</code></em></code>).
        </p><p><b>Linker crash on invalid input files. </b>
          Some older versions of GCC generated object files with
          invalid mergeable string sections when compiling with
          <code class="option">-fmerge-all-constants</code>.  This bug was fixed
          in Sourcery G++ as of version 4.1-43.  However, since system
          libraries included with some GNU/Linux distributions were
          affected by this bug, the linker has now been changed to
          accept object files with such invalid sections, rather than
          crash or produce an error message.
        </p><p><b>GDB search path bug fix. </b>
	  A bug in GDB has been fixed that formerly resulted in an internal
	  error when setting <code class="varname">solib-search-path</code> or
	  <code class="varname">solib-absolute-prefix</code> after establishing a
	  connection to a remote target.
        </p><p><b>Binutils update. </b>
	  The binutils package has been updated to version
	  2.18.50.20080215 from the FSF trunk.  This update includes
	  numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>Race fixes in <code class="function">setuid</code>. </b>
	  Several bugs in multi-threaded <code class="function">setuid</code>
	  have been fixed.  The bugs led to threads with incorrect
	  privileges and hangs at thread exit.  The
	  <code class="function">setgid</code>, <code class="function">seteuid</code>,
	  <code class="function">setegid</code>, <code class="function">setreuid</code>,
	  <code class="function">setregid</code>,
	  <code class="function">setresuid</code>, and
	  <code class="function">setresgid</code> functions were also affected.
        </p><p><b><span><strong class="command">gdbserver</strong></span> support for execution wrappers. </b>
	  <span><strong class="command">gdbserver</strong></span> has a new command-line option,
	  <code class="option">--wrapper</code>, which specifies a wrapper for any
	  programs run by <span><strong class="command">gdbserver</strong></span>.  The specified wrapper can
	  prepare the system and environment for the new program.
        </p><p><b>Read-only variables. </b>
         The C++ compiler now places variables whose types are
         instantiations of template classes in a read-only data
         section if they are declared <code class="code">const</code> and
         initialized with a constant value.  This changes reduces the
         RAM usage of affected applications.
        </p><p><b>CodeSourcery Common Startup Code Sequence. </b>
          Support for CS3, a unified startup scheme is included.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id300841"></a>Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2007q3-51</h3></div></div></div><p><b>Volatile postincrement and postdecrement bug fix. </b>
          A code generation bug that caused postincrement or
          postdecrement of a volatile object to reread the modified
          value from that object in some contexts has been fixed.  The
          bug affected code performing a comparison of the
          postincrement or postdecrement expression with a constant,
          or that was optimized to comparison with a constant.
        </p><p><b>Support for debugging with FlashPro3. </b>
          Support has been added for debugging with the Actel FlashPro3 JTAG
	  device on Windows hosts.  This works only with Actel Cortex-M1 FPGAs.
        </p><p><b>C++ class debug information. </b>
          The flag <code class="option">-femit-class-debug-always</code> 
          is now disabled by default. The flag produces 
          duplicate C++ class debug information as a 
          work-around for older debuggers. 
        </p><p><b>Improved breakpoints in constructors and template functions. </b>
          GDB now supports breakpoints on source code locations 
          that have several code addresses associated with them.
          Setting a breakpoint on a constructor automatically associates
          the breakpoint with all constructor bodies generated by GCC.  
          If you set a breakpoint on a line of a templated function, GDB
          breaks at the indicated line in all instantiations of the
          templated function. 
        </p><p><b>GDB <span><strong class="command">printf</strong></span> %p. </b>
          GDB's <span><strong class="command">printf</strong></span> command now supports the
	  <code class="literal">"%p"</code> format specifier.
        </p><p><b>Widening multiply instructions for ARMv6 and later. </b>
          GCC now makes use of the 32-to-64-bit widening multiply instructions
          (<code class="code">umull</code>, <code class="code">smull</code>, <code class="code">umlal</code>, and
          <code class="code">smlal</code>) when generating code for ARMv6 and later.
          A bug had caused these instructions to be used for ARMv3 to
          ARMv5 only.
        </p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
          The included version of GDB has been updated to
          6.6.20070821.  This update includes numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>Assembler code file name suffixes. </b>
          GCC now recognizes <code class="filename">.sx</code> as well as
          <code class="filename">.S</code> as a file name suffix indicating
          assembler code which must be preprocessed.  
          The alternate suffix may be useful in conjunction with other
          program development tools on Windows that do not distinguish
          case on filenames and treat <code class="filename">.S</code> the same
          as <code class="filename">.s</code>, which GCC uses to indicate assembler
          code without preprocessing.

          The compiler driver passes <code class="option">-I</code> options to the
          assembler, so that <code class="code">#include</code> directives
          (processed by the preprocessor) and <code class="code">.include</code>
          directives (processed by the assembler) use the same search
          path.
        </p><p><b>Dynamically-initialized <code class="code">const</code> variables. </b>
          Dynamically-initialized namespace-scope C++ variables are no
	  longer placed in read-only data sections, even when marked
	  <code class="code">const</code>.  These variables must be modified at
	  startup, so they cannot be placed in ROM, even though their
	  values cannot change once initialized.
        </p><p><b>Register allocation bug fix. </b>
	  A register allocation bug has been fixed.  Under rare 
	  circumstances, the bug caused incorrect code generation.
        </p><p><b>iWMMXt bug fix. </b>
          A GCC bug affecting code generation for iWMMXt processors
          has been fixed.  The bug caused internal compiler errors
          when compiling some functions with large stack frames.
        </p><p><b>NEON coprocessor system registers. </b>
	  The assembler now accepts the <code class="literal">MVFR0</code> and
	  <code class="literal">MVFR1</code> coprocessor registers in
	  <code class="code">fmrx</code> and <code class="code">fmxr</code> instructions.
        </p><p><b>Disabling diagnostics for use of system header and
        library directories. </b>
          The warnings for use of options such as
          <code class="option">-I/usr/include</code> when cross compiling can be
          disabled with a new option
          <code class="option">-Wno-poison-system-directories</code>.  This
          option is intended for use in chroot environments when such
          directories contain the correct headers and libraries for
          the target system rather than the host.
        </p><p><b>Default linker script. </b>
	  GCC no longer uses the simulator linker script by default.
	  To avoid a link failure, you must specify a linker script
	  explicitly with the <code class="option">-T</code> command-line option,
	  or via the <span class="guisubmenu">Properties</span> item on the
	  <span class="guimenu">Project</span> menu in the Sourcery G++ IDE.
        </p><p><b>Debugging of statically-linked threaded programs. </b>
          GDB and EGLIBC now support thread debugging when using GCC's
          <code class="option">-static</code> option.  Existing statically-linked
          programs must be relinked after upgrading EGLIBC for this
          fix.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 doubleword writeback addressing modes. </b>
	  An assembler bug that caused writeback addressing modes for
	  <code class="literal">ldrd</code> and <code class="literal">strd</code> to be
	  incorrectly encoded has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Stricter check for anonymous unions. </b>
          G++ now issues an error about invalid code that uses the
	  same name for a member of an anonymous union and an entity
	  in the surrounding namespace.  For example, you will now
	  get an error about code like:
	  </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">int i;
static union { int i; };</pre></div><p>
	  because both the global variable and the anonymous union
	  member are named <code class="literal">i</code>.  To make this code
	  valid you must change one of the declarations to use a
	  different name.
        </p><p><b>GCC update. </b>
	  The GCC package has been updated to version 4.2.1.  This version
	  includes numerous bug fixes since GCC 4.2.
	</p><p><b>Smaller code for C++ destructors. </b>
          G++ now generates more compact code to handle the
	  destruction of C++ objects declared at namespace scope or
	  declared within a function scope using the
	  <code class="code">static</code> keyword.
        </p><p><b>Robustness on Microsoft Windows. </b>
          Defects that sometimes caused GDB to become non-responsive
          on Microsoft Windows have been eliminated.
        </p><p><b>Debug information for thread-local variables. </b>
          GCC now generates accurate debug information for
          thread-local variables.
        </p><p><b>Binutils update. </b>
          The binutils package has been updated to the 2007-08-19
	  version of the pre-2.18 FSF trunk.  This contains many
	  new improvements and bug fixes.  For more information,
	  refer to the manuals for the individual utilities, and
	  to the binutils web site at
	  <code class="uri">http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/</code>.
        </p><p><b>Debugging information fix. </b>
          GCC no longer generates invalid debugging information for
          sections with no contents.  The invalid debugging
          information caused the GNU/Linux prelinker to crash.
        </p><p><b>Calls to undefined weak symbols. </b>
	  The linker now implements semantics that comply to the ARM EABI for
	  <code class="literal">R_ARM_CALL</code> and <code class="literal">T_ARM_THM_CALL</code>
	  relocations against undefined weak symbols.  These now result
	  in a jump to the next instruction.
        </p><p><b>Thread synchronization no longer uses <code class="code">swp</code>. </b>
          All of the thread synchronization functions (such as
          <code class="function">pthread_mutex_lock</code>) have been changed to
	  avoid using the <code class="code">swp</code> instruction.  This instruction
	  is deprecated in ARM V6 and executes very slowly on recent CPUs.
	  Instead, the synchronization functions now use kernel-provided
	  instruction sequences that are optimal for the processor in use.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 shift instruction aliases. </b>
	  The assembler now accepts <code class="literal">mov</code> with shifted
	  operands as an alias for Thumb-2 shift instructions.
	  For example <code class="code">mov r0, r1, lsl r2</code> is encoded as
	  <code class="code">lsl r0, r1, r2</code>.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 branches to shared libraries. </b>
	  The linker can now generate PLT stubs for
	  <code class="literal">R_ARM_THM_JUMP24</code> and
	  <code class="literal">R_ARM_THM_JUMP19</code> relocations.
	  This occurs when Thumb-2 branch instructions refer to
	  symbols imported from shared libraries.
        </p><p><b>Inlined function debugging fix. </b>
	  GDB now backtraces correctly when stopped at the first
	  instruction of an inlined function.  Earlier versions would
	  sometimes encounter internal errors in this situation.
        </p><p><b>Assembler skipping <code class="literal">\</code> characters. </b>
          A bug is fixed where the assembler would skip <code class="literal">\</code>
          characters when they appeared at certain positions in the
          input file.  This bug primarily affected assembler macros.
        </p><p><b>Improved diagnostics for region overflow. </b>
          The linker will now give more helpful diagnostics when
	  the object files being linked are too big for one of the
	  memory regions defined in the linker script.
        </p><p><b>EABI object attribute merging. </b>
          The linker now properly merges EABI object attributes into
          its output file.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 exception return instructions. </b>
	  An assembler bug that caused <code class="code">subs pc, lr, #const</code> and
	  <code class="code">movs pc, lr</code> to be incorrectly encoded has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Tag_ABI_PCS_wchar_t object attributes. </b>
	  Objects generated with <code class="option">-fshort-wchar</code> are
	  now given the correct <code class="literal">Tag_ABI_PCS_wchar_t</code>
	  EABI object attribute annotations.
        </p><p><b>Spurious compiler warnings eliminated. </b>
          GCC no longer emits warnings when linker-specific
          command-line options are provided in combination with modes
          that do not perform linking, such as with the
          <code class="option">-c</code> flag.
        </p><p><b>Debugging of inlined functions. </b>
	  GDB now supports inlined functions.  GDB can include inlined
	  functions in the stack trace; display inlined functions' arguments
	  and local variables; and step into, over, and out of inlined
	  functions.
        </p><p><b>Uppercase special register names. </b>
	  The assembler now accepts both uppercase and lowercase
	  special register names when assembling <code class="literal">msr</code>
	  and <code class="literal">mrs</code> instructions for the Microcontroller
	  profile of the ARM Architecture.
        </p><p><b>Debugger access to out-of-bounds memory. </b>
          GDB turns on <code class="code">inaccessible-by-default</code> by
          default, disallowing access to memory outside the regions
          specified in a board configuration.
        </p><p><b>Call shortening bug fix. </b>
	  GCC no longer overrides <code class="code">__attribute__((long_call))</code> on
	  calls to locally-defined functions when the function is weak,
	  or when it is in a different section from the caller.
        </p><p><b>Binutils update. </b>
	  The binutils package has been updated from 
	  version 2.17 to the pre-2.18 FSF trunk.  This is a significant
	  update with many improvements and bug fixes.
        </p><p>
	Changes to the assembler (<span><strong class="command">as</strong></span>) include:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
            On MIPS targets, support for additional processors
            and the SmartMIPS and DSP Release 2 extensions has been added.

      </p><p>
	New linker (<span><strong class="command">ld</strong></span>) features include:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
            A new command-line option <code class="option">--default-script</code>
            has been added to give more precise control over linker script

          </li><li>
            There are new command-line options
            <code class="option">-Bsymbolic-functions</code>,
            <code class="option">--dynamic-list</code>,
            <code class="option">--dynamic-list-cpp-new</code>, and
            <code class="option">--dynamic-list-data</code> to control symbols
            that should be dynamically linked.
          </li><li>
            The new <code class="option">--print-gc-sections</code> option lists
            sections removed by garbage collection.
          </li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>
	Other changes include:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
            The <span><strong class="command">objcopy</strong></span> utility has a new
            <code class="option">--extract-symbol</code> option to extract only
            symbol table information from the input file.
          </li><li>
            The <span><strong class="command">gprof</strong></span> utility now allows input files
            to have histogram records for several memory ranges, provided
            those ranges are disjoint.
          </li></ul></div><p>

        utilities, and the binutils web site at
        <code class="uri">http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/</code>.
      </p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
          The included version of GDB has been updated to
          6.6.50.20070620.  This update includes numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>Thread cancellation bug fix. </b>
          A bug in EGLIBC causing thread cancellation to fail when
          running under Linux kernels 2.6.18 and later has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Forced alignment of array variables. </b>
	  A new option <code class="option">-falign-arrays</code> has been added to
	  the compiler.  Specifying this option sets the minimum alignment
	  for array variables to be the largest power of two less than or
	  equal to their total storage size, or the biggest alignment used
	  on the machine, whichever is smaller.  This option may be helpful
	  when compiling legacy code that uses type punning on arrays that
	  does not strictly conform to the C standard.
	</p><p><b>ARM EABI compliance. </b>
	 Objects produced by Sourcery G++ are now marked as ARM ELF 
	 version 5 rather than ARM ELF version 4.  This reflects 
	 compliance with recent revisions of the ARM EABI.
	 Sourcery G++ still accepts objects marked with version 4.
	</p><p><b>Smaller C++ applications. </b>
          The C++ runtime library has been modified so that using
          namespace-scope objects with destructors does not pull in
          unnecessary support functions.  Therefore, statically linked
          C++ applications compiled with
          <code class="option">-fno-exceptions</code> are substantially smaller.
        </p><p><b>ARMv6-M floating-point bug fix. </b>
          A bug affecting conversion of wider floating-point types to
          subnormal <span class="type">float</span> values on ARMv6-M processors
          has been fixed.

	  A bug in the disassembler that caused code to be displayed 
	  as data (and vice-versa) in files with overlapping sections has 
	  been fixed.  This mainly affects the <span><strong class="command">objdump</strong></span> 
	  utility.
        </p><p><b>Installer hangs while refreshing environment. </b>
          The Sourcery G++ installer for Microsoft Windows
          now updates the <code class="envar">PATH</code> environment 
          variable without waiting for open applications to 
          acknowledge the update. This change prevents open 
          applications from blocking the installer's progress.
        </p><p><b>Improved assembler diagnostics for 8-bit offsets. </b>
          The assembler now correctly diagnoses out-of-range offsets to
	  instructions such as <code class="literal">LDRD</code> as 8-bit rather
	  than half-word offsets.
        </p><p><b>Less disk space required for installation. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite packages are smaller because multiple copies of files
          have been replaced with hard and/or symbolic links when possible.
          Both the size of the installer images and the amount of disk space
          required for an installed package have been reduced.
        </p><p><b>Thumb register corruption fix. </b>
	  A bug in the compiler that could cause register corruption in
	  Thumb mode has been fixed.  The compiler was formerly emitting
	  code to restore registers on function return that was not
	  interrupt safe.
        </p><p><b>__aeabi_lcmp. </b>
	  An error in the libgcc implementation of
	  <code class="function">__aeabi_lcmp</code> that caused
	  incorrect results to be returned has been fixed.  This is a support
	  routine defined by the ARM EABI.  GCC does not normally use this
	  routine directly, however it may be used by third-party code.
        </p><p><b>The <code class="literal">\@</code> assembler pseudo-variable. </b>
	  A bug in the assembler that caused uses of the <code class="literal">\@</code>
	  pseudo-variable to be mis-parsed as comments has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Crash when generating vector code. </b>
	  A bug that sometimes caused the compiler to crash when invoked with 
	  the <code class="option">-ftree-vectorize</code> option has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Propagation of Thumb symbol attributes. </b>
          Symbols referring to Thumb functions on ARM targets now
	  have their Thumb attribute correctly propagated to any aliases
	  defined with <code class="literal">.set</code> or <code class="literal">.symver</code>. 
        </p><p><b>Linking of non-ELF images. </b>
          A linker bug that could cause a crash when linking non-ELF
	  objects for ARM targets has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Invalid load instructions. </b>
	  A bug in the compiler which caused it to generate invalid
	  assembly (e.g. <code class="literal">ldrd r0, [#0, r2]</code>)
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>VFPv3/NEON debug information. </b>
	  A bug in the compiler which caused it to generate incorrect debug
	  information for code using VFPv3/NEON registers has been fixed.
	  The debugger is now able unable to locate and display
	  values held in these registers.
        </p><p><b>ARMv6-M system instructions. </b>
	  An assembler bug that caused some ARMv6-M system instructions to
	  be incorrectly rejected has been fixed.  The affected instructions
	  are <code class="literal">msr</code>, <code class="literal">mrs</code>,
	  <code class="literal">yield</code>, <code class="literal">wfi</code>,
	  <code class="literal">wfe</code> and <code class="literal">sev</code>.
        </p><p><b>Assembly of Thumb-2 load/store multiple instructions. </b>
	  The Thumb-2 <code class="literal">ldm</code> and <code class="literal">stm</code>
	  assembly mnemonics are now assembled to <code class="literal">ldr</code>
	  and <code class="literal">str</code> instructions when a single register is
	  transferred, as specified in the Thumb-2 Architecture Supplement.
        </p><p><b>Conditional Thumb-2 branch instructions. </b>
	  A linker bug that could cause objects involving conditional
	  Thumb-2 branch instructions to be incorrectly rejected has
	  been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Alignment bug fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that formerly caused incorrect code to be
          generated in some situations for copying structure arguments
          being passed by value.  The incorrect code caused alignment 
          errors on stack accesses on some targets.

	  Sourcery G++ now includes runtime libraries built as Thumb-2 code
	  for use on ARMv7 systems.  These can be found in the
	  <code class="filename">libc/thumb2/</code> directory.
        </p><p><b>Marvell Feroceon support. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite now generates code optimized for Marvell Feroceon CPUs
          when the <code class="option">mcpu=marvell-f</code> option is specified.  
          This option also selects runtime libraries optimized for 
          this processor.
        </p><p><b>Assembly of SRS instructions. </b>
	  An assembler bug that resulted in incorrect encoding of the
	  Thumb-2 <code class="literal">SRS</code> instruction has been fixed.
	  In addition the assembler supports explicit specification of
	  the base register, as accepted by other ARM toolchains.
        </p><p><b>VFP disassembly crash. </b>
	  A bug that caused crashes when disassembling some forms of the VFP
	  <code class="literal">fmrx</code> and <code class="literal">fmxr</code> instructions
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Improved debugging for optimized code. </b>
          GDB's ability to print and change variables' values in
          optimized code is improved.  GDB now tracks variable scopes
          more accurately, making better use of the detailed debugging
          information produced by Sourcery G++ compilers.
        </p><p><b>Improved handling of Windows paths in GDB. </b>
          GDB now properly recognizes the names of source files that
          were passed to the compiler using an absolute path on
          Windows.  You may refer to the file either by its base
          name (without any leading directory components), by the
          exact path passed to the compiler, or by its absolute
          path.
        </p><p><b>ARM Cortex-R4 performance improvements. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ Lite now generates faster code when compiling for the
	  ARM Cortex-R4 processor by scheduling instructions for the
	  processor's pipelines.  To generate code
	  for this processor, use the <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-r4</code>
	  command-line option.
        </p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
          The included version of GDB has been updated to
          6.6.50.20070228.  This update includes numerous bug fixes
          and improved support for C++ pointers to members.
        </p><p><b>Assembling Thumb store-multiple instructions. </b>
          The assembler now issues an error message instead of crashing on
          load/store multiple instructions that incorrectly use Thumb-2
          addressing modes (e.g., <code class="literal">ldmdb</code>) in legacy Thumb
          syntax mode.  If you want to use these address modes, you should use
          unified syntax mode instead.
        </p><p><b>ARM Cortex-A8 performance improvements. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ Lite now generates faster code when compiling for the
	  ARM Cortex-A8 processor by scheduling instructions for the
	  processor's dual-issue pipelines.  To generate code
	  for this processor, use the <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-a8</code>
	  command-line option.
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.2. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite for ARM GNU/Linux is now based on GCC version 4.2.
	  For more information about changes from GCC version 4.1 that was
          included in previous releases, see
          <code class="uri">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.2/changes.html</code>.
        </p><p><b>Fix --gc-sections and C++ exceptions. </b>
	  A bug in the <code class="option">--gc-sections</code> linker option has been
	  fixed.  Previously this would incorrectly remove unwinding tables,
	  breaking C++ applications that use exceptions.
        </p><p><b>Symbols defined in linker scripts. </b> A bug is fixed that caused the linker to crash in some
          circumstances when a linker script defined a symbol in an output
          section.  Typically usage is where the script contained a
          <code class="literal">__DATA_LOAD = LOADADDR(.data)</code> statement in the
          <code class="literal">.data</code> section.  </p><p><b>ARM NEON store intrinsics bug fix. </b>
          A compiler bug that incorrectly caused calls to ARM NEON
          store intrinsics (such as <code class="literal">vst1_u8</code>) to be
          optimized away has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Improvements to ARM NEON support. </b>
          The ARM NEON support in GCC has been enhanced to comply with
          new rules for containerized vector types specified in the
          ARM procedure call standard.  Additionally, the compiler now
          rejects implicit conversions between NEON polynomial vector
          types and NEON integer vector types of the same layout.
        </p><p><b>Complex numbers bug fix. </b>
          A bug that could lead to incorrect code generation for code
          using complex numbers has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Use of system header and library directories diagnosed. </b>
          The compiler and linker now diagnose the incorrect use of
          native system header and library directories for
          cross-compilation.  This typically arises from options such
          as <code class="option">-I/usr/X11R6/include</code> hard-coded in build
          scripts written without a view to cross-compilation.
        </p><p><b>Initialization priorities. </b>
          The <code class="code">constructor</code> and
	  <code class="code">destructor</code> function attributes now accept
	  an optional priority argument.  Constructors with small
	  priorities are run before those with larger priorities; the
	  opposite is true for destructors.  For example:
	  </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">void f __attribute__((constructor(500)));
void f() {
  /* Perform initialization.  */
}</pre></div><p>
	  defines a function <code class="function">f</code> with priority
	  500.  This function will be run before constructors with
	  larger priorities.  Constructor and destructors with no
	  explicit priority argument have priority 65535, the maximum
	  permitted value.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 IT block code generation error fixed. </b>
	  A bug in Thumb-2 code generation has been fixed.  This bug would
	  result in missing IT instructions, causing the assembler to
	  reject the code.
        </p><p><b>iWMMXt compiler errors. </b>
	  A compiler bug that caused invalid assembly when generating
	  iWMMXt code has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 stack decrement misassembly. </b>
	  An assembler bug that resulted in incorrect encoding of the
	  32-bit Thumb-2 form of the <code class="literal">sub sp, sp, #const</code>
	  instruction has been fixed.  Previously this was misassembled as
	  <code class="literal">subs</code>.
        </p><p><b>Naked functions. </b>
          Functions marked with <code class="code">__attribute__((naked))</code>
          no longer contain prologue and epilogue code.
          Please refer to the GCC manual for the proper use of this
          attribute.
        </p><p><b>Destructor execution order. </b>
          Prioritized destructors (whether specified with the
          <code class="code">destructor</code> function attribute in C or the
          <code class="code">init_priority</code> variable attribute in C++)
          are now executed in the correct order.  Previous releases
          ran the destructors in an indeterminate order.
        </p><p><b>Fix addr2line defect. </b>
          The binary utility <span><strong class="command">addr2line</strong></span> now
	  operates correctly on 64-bit targets with DWARF2
	  debug information.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 assembler infinite loop. </b>
          An assembler bug that would cause it to enter an infinite loop
	  when processing some Thumb-2 assembly has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Assembler warnings about overlapping multiplication operands. </b>
          The assembler no longer warns about overlapping <code class="literal">Rd</code>
	  and <code class="literal">Rm</code> operands when assembling
          <code class="literal">mul</code> and <code class="literal">mla</code> instructions
	  for the ARM architecture version six or above.
        </p><p><b>Improve handling of corrupt debug information. </b>
	  The binary utility <span><strong class="command">readelf</strong></span> now
	  copes more gracefully with corrupted DWARF 2 information.
        </p><p><b>Smaller C++ programs. </b>
          Rarely-used functions in the C++ runtime library have been
          isolated into separate object files so that they will not be
          included unless needed.  As a result, most statically
          linked C++ programs are smaller.

          Implicit conversions between generic vector types are now
          only permitted when the two vectors in question have the same number
          of elements and compatible element types.  (Note that the restriction
          involves <span class="emphasis"><em>compatible</em></span> element types, not
          implicitly-convertible element types: thus, a vector type with element
          type <code class="code">int</code> may not be implicitly converted to a vector
          type with element type <code class="code">unsigned int</code>.)
          This restriction, which is in line with specifications for SIMD
          architectures such as AltiVec, may be relaxed using the
          flag <code class="option">-flax-vector-conversions</code>.
          This flag is intended only as a compatibility measure and should not
          be used for new code.
        </p><p><b><span class="type">type_info</span> comparison fix. </b>
          Comparison of <span class="type">type_info</span> objects now uses pointer
          comparison where possible.
        </p><p><b>C++ forced unwinding fixes. </b>
          Some bugs relating to forced unwinding through C++ code have
          been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Support for additional Stellaris boards. </b>
          Linker scripts are provided for the 6xx and 8xx series Stellaris
          boards.
        </p><p><b>Linux support for USB Debug Sprite. </b>
          A new driver is included to allow the Sourcery G++ Lite USB Debug Sprite 
          to run on Linux hosts.  See <a href="chap-release.html" title="Chapter 3. Sourcery G++ Lite for ARM GNU/Linux">Chapter 3, <i>Sourcery G++ Lite for ARM GNU/Linux</i></a> for

        </p><p><b>Newlib memory use improvements. </b>
          The memory overhead of linking with newlib is reduced.
          Applications that use only a minimal set of library
          features may now require significantly less memory.

          The type-based alias analysis performed by the compiler when compiling
          with <code class="option">-O2</code> or with <code class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</code> is
          now more conservative.  The more aggressive analysis used in previous
          versions sometimes resulted in incorrect code generation.
        </p><p><b>Fully relocatable preprocessor. </b>
          When cross-compiling, the default preprocessor search path includes only 
          the directories present in the installed toolchain. This speeds up the 
          preprocessor and prevents the unintentional use of unrelated files and 
          directories on the machine where it is installed.

          Support has been added in binutils and the prelinker
          for new-style (also known as <code class="literal">DT_GNU_HASH</code>)
          symbol hashing.  This can dramatically speed up symbol
          resolution time and is particularly applicable in environments
          where full prelinking is not possible (for example where
          shared libraries are dynamically opened at
          runtime).  The new-style hashing may be enabled by passing
          <code class="option">--hash-style=gnu</code> to the linker.
        </p><p><b>Prelinker update. </b>
          The prelinker has been updated to the current

          used to determine when hardware breakpoints should automatically
          be used (for instance the <span><strong class="command">step</strong></span>,
          <span><strong class="command">next</strong></span> and <span><strong class="command">finish</strong></span> commands).
          Separate ROM configurations have been removed from the Eclipse
          debugger menu.  The Eclipse GUI has been extended to provide
          improved support for debugging programs in ROM, when a memory

        </p><p><b>Incompatible changes to Stellaris linker scripts. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite now supports linking executables to run from RAM as well
          as ROM.  As part of this change, there are now separate RAM and ROM
          versions of the linker scripts for each supported board, and the former
          ROM-based versions have been renamed.  For example, if you were 
          formerly linking with <code class="option">-T lm3s10x.ld</code>, you should now use
          <code class="option">-T lm3s10x-rom.ld</code> to get the same behavior.

          Non-executable stacks can provide increased security against
          some forms of buffer overflow attacks. The tools involved must
          coordinate the annotation of required stack permissions, either
          executable, or non-executable.  For ARM GNU/Linux targets the
