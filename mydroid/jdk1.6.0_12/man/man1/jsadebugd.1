\f3jsadebugd\fP attaches to a Java process or core file and acts as a debug server. Remote clients such as jstack(1), jmap(1), and jinfo(1) can attach to the server using Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI). Before starting \f2jsadebugd\fP, 
.na

where \f2$JAVA_HOME\fP is the JDK installation directory. If rmiregistry was not started, jsadebugd will start an rmiregistry in a standard (1099) port internally. Debug server may be stopped by sending SIGINT (pressing Ctrl\-C) to it.
