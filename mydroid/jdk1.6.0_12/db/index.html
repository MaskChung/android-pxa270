<h3>Relationship between Java&#153; DB and Derby</h3>

Java&#153; DB is Sun Microsystems' supported distribution of the open source Apache Derby 100% Java&#153; technology relational database system.
<p>The Java&#153; DB product includes Apache Derby without any modification whatsoever to the underlying source code.</p>
<p><a href="http://developers.sun.com/javadb/support/">Java&#153; DB technical support</a> is available for purchase through Sun Microsystems.</p>
<p>Because Java&#153; DB and Apache Derby have the same functionality, the Java DB documentation refers to the core functionality as Derby.</p>

<a name="using"/><h3>Using Derby</h3>
<p>
For information on developing and deploying an application with Derby, see the <a href="docs/html/devguide/index.html"/>Derby Developer's Guide</a> <a href="docs/html/devguide/devguide-single.html">[HTML Book]</a> <a href="docs/pdf/devguide/derbydev.pdf"/>[PDF]</a>.

Derby's JDBC API is documented in two sets of javadoc:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="javadoc/jdbc3/index.html">JDBC 3.0 Public API</a> - Consult
this javadoc if your application runs on
J2SE 1.4, or J2SE 5.0. Also consult this javadoc if your
application runs with the Java ME CDC/Foundation 1.1 Profile (JSR-169).</li>
<li><a href="javadoc/jdbc4/index.html">JDBC 4.0 Public API</a> - Consult this
javadoc if your application runs on Java SE 6.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For information on setting up and using the Derby Network Server, which provides a client/server access model for Derby databases on machines connected over a network, please read the <a href="docs/html/adminguide/index.html">Derby Server and Administration Guide</a> <a href="docs/html/adminguide/adminguide-single.html">[HTML Book]</a> <a href="docs/pdf/adminguide/derbyadmin.pdf">[PDF]</a>.
