<h1 class="topictitle1">Enabling the encrypted user ID and password security mechanism</h1>


<div>
<p>To use the encrypted user ID and password security mechanism,
you need a Java environment whith an JCE (Java Cryptography Extension)
which supports the Diffie-Hellman algorithm with a public prime of
256 bits. Sun's <span>Javaâ„¢ 2 Platform, Standard Edition, Version
1.4 (J2SE)</span> and later requires a public prime of 512 bits or
more. An alternative mechanism if the 256 bit public prime is not
supported, is <em>STRONG_PASSWORD_SUBSTITUTE_SECURITY</em>.
</p>

<div class="p">To use the encrypted user id and password security mechanism during
JDBC connection using the network client, specify the <samp class="codeph">securityMechanism</samp> in
the connection property. <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>If an encrypted database is booted in
the Network Server, users can connect to the database without giving the <samp class="codeph">bootPassword</samp>.
The first connection to the database must provide the <samp class="codeph">bootPassword</samp>,
but all subsequent connections do not need to supply it. To remove access
from the encrypted database, use the <samp class="codeph">shutdown=true</samp> option
to shut down the database.</div>
