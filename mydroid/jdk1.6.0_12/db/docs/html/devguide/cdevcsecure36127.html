<h1 class="topictitle1">Enabling user authentication</h1>



<div><p>To enable user authentication, set the <em>derby.connection.requireAuthentication</em> property
to true. Otherwise, <span>Derby</span> does
not require a user name and password. You can set this property as a system-wide
property or as a database-wide property.</p>

<p>For a multi-user product, you would typically set it for the system in
the <em>derby.properties</em> file for your server, since it is in a trusted
environment.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>If you start a <span>Derby</span> system
with user authentication enabled but without defining at least one user, you
will not be able to shut down the system gracefully. When <span>Derby</span> is
running in a connectivity server and user authentication is turned on, stopping
the server requires a user name and password. You will need to alter shutdown
scripts accordingly. </div>

<p>
</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>
  Additionally, if you create and start
  a <span>Derby</span> system
  with user authentication and
  <a href="cdevcsecure36595.html#cdevcsecure36595">SQL authorization</a>
  both enabled, or plan to enable them later,
  you should make sure you create
  the database by connecting as the user that is to become the
  <a href="cdevcsecureDbOwner.html#cdevcsecureDbOwner">database
    owner</a>. 
  
  If you neglect to supply a user when the database is created, the
  database owner will by default become "APP". If you later enable
  both authentication and SQL authorization and "APP" is a not valid
  user name, you will not be able to perform operations restricted to
  the database owner, including shutting down the database (as opposed
  to the full system which may currently be shut down by any
  authenticated user, see previous note). Nor will you be able to
  (re)encrypt the database nor perform a full upgrade of it.
