<h1 class="topictitle1">Booting databases</h1>



<div><p>The default configuration for <span>Derby</span> is
to <em>boot</em> (or start) a database when an application first makes a connection
to it. When <span>Derby</span> boots
a database, it checks to see if recovery needs to be run on the database,
so in some unusual cases booting can take some time.</p>

<p>You can also configure your system to automatically boot all databases
in the system when it starts up; see <em>derby.system.bootAll</em> in the <span><em>Tuning Java DB</em></span> manual. Because of the time needed
to boot a database, the number of databases in the system directory affects
startup performance if you use that configuration. </p>

<p>Once a database has been booted within a <span>Derby</span> system,
it remains active until the <span>Derby</span> system
has been shut down or until you shut down the database individually.</p>

<p>When <span>Derby</span> boots a database,
a message is added to the error log. The message includes the <span>Derby</span> version
that the database was booted with, for example:</p>

<pre>2006-10-04 03:54:06.196 GMT: Booting <span>Derby</span> version <span>Apache Derby</span>
- 10.2.1.5 - (448900): instance c013800d-00fd-0cb0-e736-ffffd1025a25 on
database directory sample</pre>

<p>The number of databases running in a <span>Derby</span> system
is limited only by the amount of memory available in the JVM.</p>
