<div><p>In most cases, you access databases from the file system. However,
it is also possible to access databases from the classpath. The databases
can be archived into a jar or zip file or left as is.</p>

<p>All such databases are read-only.</p>

<p>To access an unarchived database from the classpath, specify the name of
the database relative to the directory in the classpath. You can use the classpath
subprotocol if such a database is ambiguous within the directory system.</p>

<p>For example, for a database called <em>sample</em> in <em>C:\<span>derby</span>\demo\databases</em>,
you can put the <em>C:\<span>derby</span>\demo\databases</em> directory
in the classpath and access <em>sample</em> like this:</p>

<pre>
jdbc:derby:/sample
</pre>

<p>The forward slash is required before <em>sample</em> to indicate that it
is relative to <em>C:\<span>derby</span>\demo\databases</em> directory.</p>

<p>If only <em>C:\<span>derby</span></em> were
in the class path, you could access <em>sample</em> (read-only) like this:</p>

<pre>
jdbc:derby:/demo/databases/sample
</pre>
