<div><p>In an embedded environment, when an application shuts down, it
should first shut down <span>Derby</span>.</p>

<div class="section"> <p>If the application that started the embedded <span>Derby</span> quits
but leaves the JVM running, <span>Derby</span> continues
to run and is available for database connections.</p>
<p>In an embedded system,
the application shuts down the <span>Derby</span> system
by issuing the following JDBC call:</p>
<pre>DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:derby:;shutdown=true");</pre>
<p>Shutdown
commands always raise <em>SQLExceptions</em>.</p>
<p>When a <span>Derby</span> system
shuts down, a message goes to the error log:</p>
<pre>Sat Jan 10 14:31:54 PDT 2005:
Shutting down instance 80000001-00d0-8bdf-d115-000a0a0b2d00</pre>
<p>Typically,
an application using an embedded <span>Derby</span> engine
shuts down <span>Derby</span> just before
shutting itself down. However, an application can shut down <span>Derby</span> and
later restart it in the same JVM session. To restart <span>Derby</span> successfully,
the JVM needs to unload <em>org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver</em>, so that
it can reload it when it restarts <span>Derby</span>.
(Loading the local driver starts <span>Derby</span>.) </p>
<p>You
cannot explicitly request that the JVM unload a class, but you can ensure
that the <em>EmbeddedDriver</em> class is unloaded by using a <samp class="codeph"><em>System.gc()</em></samp> to
force it to garbage collect classes that are no longer needed. Running with <samp class="codeph"><em>-nogc</em></samp> or <samp class="codeph"><em>-noclassgc</em></samp> definitely <em>prevents</em> the class from being unloaded and makes you unable to restart <span>Derby</span> in the same JVM. </p>
<p>It
is also possible to shut down a single database instead of the entire <span>Derby</span> system. See <a href="tdevdvlp40464.html#tdevdvlp40464">Shutting down Derby or an individual database</a>.
You can reboot a database in the same <span>Derby</span> session
after shutting it down.</p>
