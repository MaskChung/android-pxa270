<div><p>Soft upgrade allows you to run a newer version of <span>Derby</span> against
an existing database without having to fully upgrade the database. This means
that you can continue to run an older version of <span>Derby</span> against
the database.</p>

<div class="section"> <p>If you perform a soft upgrade, you will not be able to perform
certain functions that are not available in older versions of <span>Derby</span>.
For example, the following <span>Derby</span> Version
10.2 features cannot be used in a database that has been soft upgraded from
10.0: </p>
 <ul>
<li>SYNONYMS</li>

<li>Creating tables using the GENERATED BY DEFAULT option for identity columns</li>

<li>Reclaiming unused space using the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE
procedure</li>

</ul>
 <p> The following 10.2 features cannot be accessed from a database which
has been soft upgraded from 10.1: </p>
<ul>
<li>GRANT/REVOKE</li>

<li>Online backup procedures SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE_NOWAIT  and
SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE_AND_ENABLE_LOG_ARCHIVE_MODE_NOWAIT.</li>

<li>The encryption or re-encryption of a database with a new phrase/key.</li>

</ul>
 <p> Other new features in <span>Derby</span> that
do not affect database structure, such as using timestamp arithmetic, are
allowed in a soft upgraded database.</p>
<p>To perform a soft upgrade on a
database created using an earlier version of <span>Derby</span>:</p>
</div>


<div class="p"><span> Simply connect to the database, as shown in the following example:</span>
 <pre>connect 'jdbc:derby:sample'</pre>
In this example, the
sample database is a Version 10.0 database.</div>
