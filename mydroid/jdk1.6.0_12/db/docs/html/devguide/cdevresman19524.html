<h1 class="topictitle1">Using Derby as a J2EE resource manager</h1>



<div><p>J2EE, or the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, is a standard
for development of enterprise applications based on reusable components in
a multi-tier environment. In addition to the features of the Java 2 Platform,
Standard Edition (J2SE), J2EE adds support for Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs),
Java Server Pages (JSPs), Servlets, XML and many more. The J2EE architecture
is used to bring together existing technologies and enterprise applications
in a single, manageable environment.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> is a J2EE-conformant
component in a distributed J2EE system. As such, it is one part of a larger
system that includes, among other things, a JNDI server, a connection pool
module, a transaction manager, a resource manager, and user applications.
Within this system, <span>Derby</span> can
serve as the resource manager.</p>

<p>For more information on J2EE and how to work in this environment, see the
J2EE specification available at <span class="synph"><span class="var">http://java.sun.com/j2ee/docs.html</span></span>.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>This chapter does not show you how to use <span>Derby</span> as
a Resource Manager. Instead, it provides details specific to <span>Derby</span> that
are not covered in the specification. This information is useful to programmers
developing other modules in a distributed J2EE system, not to end-user application
developers.</div>

<p>In order to qualify as a resource manager in a J2EE system, J2EE requires
these basic areas of support. These three areas of support involve implementation
of APIS and are described in "J2EE Compliance: Java Transaction API and javax.sql
Extensions" in the <cite><span><em>Java DB Reference Manual</em></span></cite>.</p>

<p>This chapter describes the <span>Derby</span> classes
that implement the APIs and provides some implementation-specific details.</p>

Derby provides two variants of each DataSource interface defined by the JDBC API.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevresman89722.html">Getting a DataSource</a></strong><br />
Normally, you can simply work with the interfaces for javax.sql.DataSource, javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource, and javax.sql.XADataSource, as shown in the following examples.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevresman92946.html">Shutting down or creating a database</a></strong><br />
If you need to shut down or create a database, it is easiest just to work with the Derby-specific implementations of interfaces, as shown in these examples.</li>
