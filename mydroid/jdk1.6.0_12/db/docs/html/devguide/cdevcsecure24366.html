<div><p><span>Derby</span> provides
a way for you to encrypt your data on disk.</p>

<p>Typically, database systems encrypt and decrypt data in transport over
the network, using industry-standard systems. This system works well for client/server
databases; the server is assumed to be in a trusted, safe environment, managed
by a system administrator. In addition, the recipient of the data is trusted
and should be capable of protecting the data. The only risk comes when transporting
data over the wire, and data encryption happens during network transport only.</p>

<p>However, <span>Derby</span> databases
are platform-independent files that are designed to be easily shared in a
number of ways, including transport over the Internet. Recipients of the data
might not know how, or might not have the means, to properly protect the data.</p>

<p>This data encryption feature provides the ability to store user data in
an encrypted form. The user who boots the database must provide a boot password.</p>
