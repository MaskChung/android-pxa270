<h1 class="topictitle1">Relationship between Java DB and 
<span>Derby</span></h1>



<div><p>Java™ DB is a relational database management 
system that is based on the Java programming language and SQL. Java DB is a 
commercial release of the Apache Software Foundation's (ASF) open source 
relational database project. The Apache project is called 
<span>Derby</span>.</p>

<p>The Java DB product includes 
<span>Derby</span> without any 
modification whatsoever to the underlying source code.</p>


<p>Technical support is available for purchase for the Java DB product through 
Sun.</p>


<p>Because Java DB and <span>Derby</span> 
have the same functionality, the Java DB documentation refers to the core 
functionality as <span>Derby</span>.</p>


<p>Java DB <span>Version 10.4</span> is based 
on the 
<span>Derby</span> <span>Version 10.4</span> 
release. References to 
"<span>Derby</span>" in the 
Java DB documentation refer to the 
<span>Version 10.4</span> release of  
<span>Apache Derby</span>.</p>
