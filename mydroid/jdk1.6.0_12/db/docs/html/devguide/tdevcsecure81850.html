<ol>
<li><span>Encrypt the database when you create it.</span></li>

<li><span>Configure all security features as database-level properties. 
These properties are stored in the database (which is encrypted). See <cite><span><em>Tuning Java DB</em></span></cite>.</span></li>

<li><span>Turn on protection for database-level properties so that they cannot
be overridden by system properties by setting the <em>derby.database.propertiesOnly</em> property
to TRUE.</span></li>

<li><span>To prevent unauthorized users from accessing databases once they
are booted, turn on user authentication for the database and configure user
authorization for the database.</span></li>

<li><span>If you are using <span>Derby</span>'s
built-in users, configure each user as a database-level property so that user
names and passwords can be encrypted.</span></li>
