<div><p><span>Derby</span> application
developers use JDBC, the application programming interface that makes it possible
to access relational databases from Java programs.</p>

<p>The JDBC API is part of the Javaâ„¢ 2 Platform, Standard Edition and is
not specific to <span>Derby</span>.
It consists of the <em>java.sql</em> and <em>javax.sql</em> packages, which is
a set of classes and interfaces that make it possible to access databases
(from a number of different vendors, not just <span>Derby</span>)
from a Java application.</p>

<p>To develop <span>Derby</span> applications
successfully, you will need to learn JDBC. This section does not teach you
how to program with the JDBC API.</p>

<p>This section covers the details of application programming that are specific
to <span>Derby</span> applications.
For example, all JDBC applications typically start their DBMS's JDBC driver
and use a connection URL to connect to a database. This chapter gives you
the details of how to start <span>Derby</span>'s
JDBC driver and how to work with <span>Derby</span>'s
connection URL to accomplish various tasks. It also covers essential <span>Derby</span> concepts
such as the <span>Derby</span> system.</p>

<p>You will find reference information about the particulars of <span>Derby</span>'s
implementation of JDBC in the <cite><span><em>Java DB Reference Manual</em></span></cite>. </p>

<p><span>Derby</span> application developers
will need to learn SQL. <em>SQL</em> is the standard query language used with
relational databases and is not tied to a particular programming language.
No matter how a particular RDBMS has been implemented, the user can design
databases and insert, modify, and retrieve data using the standard SQL statements
and well-defined data types. SQL-92 is the version of SQL standardized by
ANSI and ISO in 1992; <span>Derby</span> supports
entry-level SQL-92 as well as some higher-level features. Entry-level SQL-92
is a subset of full SQL-92 specified by ANSI and ISO that is supported by
nearly all major DBMSs today. This chapter does not teach you SQL. You will
find reference information about the particulars of <span>Derby</span>'s
implementation of SQL in the <cite><span><em>Java DB Reference Manual</em></span></cite>.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> implements JDBC
that allows <span>Derby</span> to serve
as a resource manager in a J2EE compliant system.</p>
