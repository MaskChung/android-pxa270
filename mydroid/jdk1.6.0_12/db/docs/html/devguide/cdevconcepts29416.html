<h1 class="topictitle1">Using auto-commit</h1>



<div><p>A new connection to a <span>Derby</span> database
is in auto-commit mode by default, as specified by the JDBC standard.</p>

<p>Auto-commit mode means that when a statement is completed, the method <em>commit</em> is
called on that statement automatically. Auto-commit in effect makes every
SQL statement a transaction. The commit occurs when the statement completes
or the next statement is executed, whichever comes first. In the case of a
statement returning a <samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet</em></samp>, the statement completes
when the last row of the <samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet</em></samp> has been retrieved
or the <samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet</em></samp> has been closed explicitly.</p>

<p>Some applications might prefer to work with <span>Derby</span> in
auto-commit mode; some might prefer to work with auto-commit turned off. You
should be aware of the implications of using either model.</p>

<p>You should be aware of the following when you use auto-commit:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Cursors</em>   <p>You cannot use auto-commit if you do any positioned
updates or deletes (that is, an update or delete statement with a "WHERE CURRENT
OF" clause) on cursors which have the <em>close cursors on commit</em> option
set.</p>
<p>Auto-commit automatically closes cursors, which are explicitly
opened with the <em>close on commit</em> option, when you do any in-place updates
or deletes.</p>
<p>A cursor declared to be held across commit can execute updates
and issue multiple commits before closing the cursor, but the cursor must
be repositioned before any statement following the commit. If this is attempted
with auto-commit on, an error is generated. </p>
</li>

<li><em>Database-side JDBC Procedures (procedures using nested connections)</em> 
 <p>You cannot execute procedures within SQL statements if those procedures
perform a commit or rollback on the current connection. Since in the auto-commit
mode all SQL statements are implicitly committed, <span>Derby</span> turns
off auto-commit during execution of database-side procedures and turns it
back on when the method completes.</p>
<p>Procedures that use nested connections
are not permitted to turn auto-commit on or off or to commit or roll back.</p>
</li>

<li><em>Table-level locking and the SERIALIZABLE isolation level</em>   <p>When
an application uses table-level locking and the SERIALIZABLE isolation level,
all statements that access tables hold at least shared table locks. Shared
locks prevent other transactions that update data from accessing the table.
A transaction holds a lock on a table until the transaction commits. <em>So
even a SELECT statement holds a shared lock on a table until its connection
commits and a new transaction begins. </em></p>
