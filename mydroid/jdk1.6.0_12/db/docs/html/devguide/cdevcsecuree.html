<div><p><span>Derby</span> can be
deployed in a number of ways and in a number of different environments. The
security needs of the <span>Derby</span> system
are also diverse.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> supplies or supports
the following optional security mechanisms:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>User authentication</em>   <p><span>Derby</span> verifies
user names and passwords before permitting them access to the <span>Derby</span> system.</p>
</li>

<li><em>User authorization</em>   <p>A means of granting specific users permission
to read a database or to write to a database.</p>
</li>

<li><em>Disk encryption</em>   <p>A means of encrypting <span>Derby</span> data
stored on disk.</p>
</li>

<li><em>Validation of Certificate for Signed Jar Files</em>   <p>In a Java 2
environment, <span>Derby</span> validates
certificates for classes loaded from signed jar files.</p>
  </li>

<li><em>Network encryption and authentication</em><p><span>Derby</span>
network traffic may be encrypted with SSL/TLS. SSL/TLS certificate
authentication is also supported. See <em>"Network encryption and authentication with SSL/TLS"</em> in the
<cite><span><em>Java DB Server and Administration Guide</em></span></cite> for
details.</p>
</li>
 
</ul>

<div class="p">The following figure shows some of the <span>Derby</span> security
mechanisms at work in a client/server environment. User authentication is
performed by accessing an LDAP Directory Service. The data in the database
is not encrypted in this trusted environment.<div class="fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Example

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure12392.html">Configuring security for your environment</a></strong><br />
In most cases, you enable Derby's security features through the use of properties. It is important to understand the best way of setting properties for your environment.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure42374.html">Working with user authentication</a></strong><br />
Derby provides support for user authentication. User authentication means that Derby authenticates the name and password for a user before allowing that user access to the system.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure37241.html">Users and authorization identifiers</a></strong><br />
User names within the Derby system are known as authorization identifiers. The authorization identifier is a string that represents the name of the user, if one was provided in the connection request.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure36595.html">User authorizations</a></strong><br />
When you specify user authorizations, Derby verifies that a user has been granted permission to access a system, database, object, or SQL action.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure24366.html">Encrypting databases on disk</a></strong><br />
Derby provides a way for you to encrypt your data on disk.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure90988.html">Signed jar files</a></strong><br />
In a Java 2 environment, Derby can detect digital signatures on jar files. When attempting to load a class from a signed jar file stored in the database, Derby will verify the validity of the signature.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure10983.html">Notes on the Derby security features</a></strong><br />
TheDerby security model has some basic limitations.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure51876.html">User authentication and authorization examples</a></strong><br />
This section provides examples on using user authentication and authorization in Derby in either a client/server environment or in an embedded environment.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcbabejdfj.html">Running Derby under a security manager</a></strong><br />
When running within an application or application server with a Java 2 Security Manager enabled, Derby must be granted certain permissions to execute and access database files.</li>
