<div><p>This procedure requires a system with multiple databases and some
administrative resources.</p>

<ol>
<li><span>Configure security features as system properties.  See <cite><span><em>Tuning Java DB</em></span></cite>.</span></li>

<li><span>Provide administrative-level protection for the <em>derby.properties</em> file
and <span>Derby</span> databases. For
example, you can protect these files and directories with operating system
permissions and firewalls.</span></li>

<li><span>Turn on user authentication for your system.  All users must provide
valid user IDs and passwords to access the <span>Derby</span> system.
If you are using <span>Derby</span>'s
built-in users, configure users for the system in the <em>derby.properties</em> file.
Provide the protection for this file.</span></li>

<li><span>Configure user authorization for sensitive databases in your system.
 Only designated users will be able to access sensitive databases. You typically
configure user authorization with database-level properties. It is also possible
to configure user authorization with system-level properties. This is useful
when you are developing systems or when all databases have the same level
of sensitivity.</span></li>

<li><span>Check and if necessary configure your Derby network security 
according to your environment. See the section "Network client security" in the
<cite><span><em>Java DB Server and Administration Guide</em></span></cite>.</span></li>
