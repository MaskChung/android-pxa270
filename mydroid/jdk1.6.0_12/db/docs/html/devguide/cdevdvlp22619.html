<div><p>Do not use <samp class="codeph"><em>interrupt</em></samp> calls to notify threads
that are accessing a database, because <span>Derby</span> will
catch the <samp class="codeph"><em>interrupt</em></samp> call and close the connection
to the database. Use <samp class="codeph"><em>wait</em></samp> and <samp class="codeph"><em>notify</em></samp> calls
instead.</p>

<p>This will not happen in a client/server environment, but if you want your
application to work in either environment it is good practice to follow this
rule.</p>

<p>There are also special considerations when working with more than one database
thread in an application.</p>
