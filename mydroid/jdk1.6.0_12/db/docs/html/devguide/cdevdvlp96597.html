<div><p>You could potentially have two instances of a <span>Derby</span> system
(JVM) running on the same machine at the same time. Each instance must run
in a different JVM. Two separate instances of <span>Derby</span> must
not access the same database.</p>

<p>For example, in an embedded environment, an application that accesses <span>Derby</span> databases starts up the
local JDBC driver, which starts up an instance of <span>Derby</span>.
If you start another application, such as ij, and connect to the same database,
severe database corruption can result. See <a href="cdevdvlp20458.html#cdevdvlp20458">Double-booting system behavior</a>.</p>
