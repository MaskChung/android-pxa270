<h1 class="topictitle1">Authorization identifiers, user authentication, and user authorization</h1>



<div><p>When working with both user authentication and user authorization,
you need to understand how user names are treated by each system.</p>

<p>If an external authentication system is used, the conversion of the user's
name to an authorization identifier does not happen until <em>after</em> authentication
has occurred but <em>before</em> user authorization. Imagine, for example, a
user named Fred.</p>

<ul>
<li>Within the user authentication system, Fred is known as <em>FRed</em>. Your
external user authorization service is case-sensitive, so Fred must always
type his name that way.   <pre>Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:derby:myDB", "FRed", "flintstone");</pre>
</li>

<li>Within the <span>Derby</span> user
authorization system, Fred becomes a case-insensitive authorization identifier.
Fred is known as <em>FRED</em>.</li>

<li>When specifying which users are authorized to access the accounting database,
you must list Fred's authorization identifier, <em>FRED</em> (which you can
type as <em>FRED</em>, <em>FREd</em>, or <em>fred</em>, since the system automatically
converts it to all-uppercase).   <pre><strong>derby.fullAccessUsers=sa,FRED,mary</strong></pre>
</li>

</ul>

<p>Let's take a second example, where Fred has a slightly different name within
the user authentication system.</p>

<ul>
<li>Within the user authentication system, Fred is known as <em>Fred!</em>.
You must now put double quotes around the name, because it is not a valid <samp class="codeph"><em>SQL92Identifier</em></samp>.
(<span>Derby</span> knows to remove
the double quotes when passing the name to the external authentication system.)
  <pre>Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:derby:myDB", "\"Fred!\"", "flintstone");</pre>
</li>

<li>Within the <span>Derby</span> user
authorization system, <em>Fred</em> becomes a case-sensitive authorization identifier.
Fred is known as <em>Fred!</em>.</li>

<li>When specifying which users are authorized to access the accounting database,
you must list Fred's authorization identifier, <em>"Fred!"</em> (which you must
always delimit with double quotation marks).   <pre>derby.fullAccessUsers=sa,"Fred!",manager</pre>
</li>

</ul>

<p>As shown in the first example, your external authentication system may
be case-sensitive, whereas the authorization identifier within <span>Derby</span> may
not be. If your authentication system allows two distinct users whose names
differ by case, delimit all user names within the connection request to make
all user names case-sensitive within the <span>Derby</span> system.
In addition, you must also delimit user names that do not conform to <em>SQL92Identifier</em> rules
with double quotes.</p>
