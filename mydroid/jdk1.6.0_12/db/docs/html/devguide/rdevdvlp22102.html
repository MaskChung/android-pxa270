<div><p>The examples in this section use the syntax of the connection URL
for use in an embedded environment.</p>

<div class="section"><p>This information also applies to the client connection URL in
a client/server environment. For reference information about client connection
URLs, see "java.sql.Connection interface" in the <cite><span><em>Java DB Reference Manual</em></span></cite>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"> <ul>
<li><em>jdbc:derby:db1</em>   <p>Open a connection to the database <em>db1</em>. <em>db1</em> is
a directory located in the system directory.</p>
</li>

<li><em>jdbc:derby:london/sales</em>   <p>Open a connection to the database <em>london/sales</em>. <em>london</em> is
a subdirectory of the system directory, and <em>sales</em> is a subdirectory
of the directory <em>london</em>.</p>
</li>

<li><em>jdbc:derby:/reference/phrases/french</em>   <p>Open a connection to
the database <em>/reference/phrases/french</em>.</p>
  <p>On a UNIX system, this
would be the path of the directory. On a Windows system, the path would be <em>C:\reference\phrases\french</em> if
the current drive were <em>C. </em>If a jar file storing databases were in the
user's classpath, this could also be a path within the jar file.</p>
</li>

<li><em>jdbc:derby:a:/demo/sample</em>   <p>Open a connection to the database
stored in the directory <em>\demo\sample</em> on drive <em>A</em> (usually the
floppy drive) on a Windows system.</p>
</li>

<li><em>jdbc:<span>derby</span>:c:/databases/salesdb
jdbc:derby:salesdb</em>   <p>These two connection URLs connect to the same
database, <em>salesdb</em>, on a Windows platform if the system directory of
the <span>Derby</span> system is <em>C:\databases</em>.</p>
</li>

<li><em>jdbc:derby:support/bugsdb;create=true</em>   <p>Create the database <em>support/bugsdb</em> in
the system directory, automatically creating the intermediate directory <em>support</em> if
it does not exist.</p>
</li>

<li><em>jdbc:derby:sample;shutdown=true</em>   <p>Shut down the <em>sample</em> database.
(Authentication is not enabled, so no user credentials are required.)
</p>
</li>

<li><em>jdbc:derby:/myDB</em>   <p>Access <em>myDB</em> (which is directly in
a directory in the classpath) as a read-only database.</p>
</li>

<li><em>jdbc:derby:classpath:/myDB</em>   <p>Access <em>myDB</em> (which is directly
in a directory in the classpath) as a read-only database. The reason for using
the subsubprotocol is that it might  have the same path as a database in the
directory structure.</p>
</li>

<li><em>jdbc:derby:jar:(C:/dbs.jar)products/boiledfood</em>   <p>Access the
read-only database <em>boiledfood</em> in the <em>products</em> directory from
the jar file <em>C:/dbs.jar</em>.</p>
</li>

<li><em>jdbc:derby:directory:myDB</em>   <p>Access <em>myDB</em>, which is in
the system directory. The reason for using the <samp class="codeph"><em>directory:</em></samp> subsubprotocol
is that it might happen to have the same path as a database in the classpath.</p>
</li>
