<dt class="dlterm"><span><em>Tuning Java DB</em></span></dt>

<dd>Explains how to configure and tune Java DB through
properties and provides reference information on properties. This guide also 
offers performance tips, an in-depth discussion of performance, and information 
about the Java DB optimizer.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm"><span><em>Java DB Tools and Utilities Guide</em></span></dt>

<dd>Part One of this guide discusses configuring servers, how to program client
applications, and database administration. In addition, some systems might
require administrative tasks such as backing up databases. These tasks
are independent of any server framework but are unique to multi-user or large
systems. <p>Part Two of this guide discusses administrative issues such as
backups and debugging deadlocks.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Java DB API Reference</dt>

<dd>An API Reference that is automatically generated for all public Java DB classes.
