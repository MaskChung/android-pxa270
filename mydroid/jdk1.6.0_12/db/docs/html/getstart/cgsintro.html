<div><p>Welcome to <span>Derby</span>! <span>Derby</span> is a full-featured, open
source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is based on Javaâ„¢ and
SQL.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> is written and
implemented completely in the Java programming language. <span>Derby</span> provides
users with a small-footprint standards-based database engine that can be tightly
embedded into any Java based solution. <span>Derby</span> ensures
data integrity and provides sophisticated transaction support. In the default
configuration there is no separate database server to be installed or maintained
by the end user. For more information on <span>Derby</span>,
visit the <span>Derby</span> Web site
at <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/" target="_blank">http://db.apache.org/derby</a>.</p>

<p>Before you install <span>Derby</span>,
you should understand the deployment options and system requirements.</p>

The Derby software distribution provides two basic deployment options (also referred to as frameworks), the simple embedded option and the Derby Network Server option.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cgsintsr.html">System requirements</a></strong><br />
Derby is a database engine written completely in Java. The database will run in any certified Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="rgsdocs17307.html">Product documentation for Java DB</a></strong><br />
The Java DB product documentation consists of the Java DB manuals and the API reference.</li>
