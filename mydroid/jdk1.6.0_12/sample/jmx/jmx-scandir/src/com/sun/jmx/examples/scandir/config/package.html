  <p>
     This package defines plain Java Beans, annotated for
     XML bindings, and used to store and model the scandir 
     application configuration.
  </p>
  <p>All the Java Beans defined in this package have been 
     designed to be <i>naturally serialized</i> by JAXB.
     Their bean properties were designed to minimize
     the number of XML annotation required, as well as 
     making them transparently convertible by the 
     JMX MXBean framework.
  </p>
  <p>The {@link com.sun.jmx.examples.scandir.config.ScanManagerConfig} 
     bean corresponds to the root element of the application's configuration.
     From an instance of this element, the 
     {@link com.sun.jmx.examples.scandir.ScanManagerMXBean} will be
     able to initialize the 
     {@link com.sun.jmx.examples.scandir.ResultLogManagerMXBean} and will
     create, register and initialize 
     {@link com.sun.jmx.examples.scandir.DirectoryScannerMXBean DirectoryScannerMXBeans}
  </p>
  <p>The {@link com.sun.jmx.examples.scandir.config.XmlConfigUtils} class is a simple utility
     classes used to deal with XML and XML configuration files.
  </p>
  <p>The {@link com.sun.jmx.examples.scandir.config.ResultRecord ResultRecords} 
     are used to store the results of directory scans in the result logs
     managed by the {@link com.sun.jmx.examples.scandir.ResultLogManagerMXBean}
