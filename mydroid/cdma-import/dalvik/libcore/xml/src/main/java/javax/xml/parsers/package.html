      Provides facilities for parsing XML documents and building Document Object
      Model (DOM) trees from them. The
      {@link javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory} class serves as an entry point
      to event-based XML parsing. The
      {@link javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory} class is an entry point
      for dealing with DOM trees. Both factories are usually configured
      before their factory methods are invoked. They then try to create a
      {@link javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser} or a
      {@link javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder} (respectively) suiting the
      application's needs. If none can be found, an Exception is thrown.

      Note that in order to cater for resource-constrained environments,
      Android's XML packages currently only provide DOM Level 2 Core support
      and a non-validating parser. This means that (a) the interface for the
      various DOM classes might differ from other implementations and (b)
      requesting a validating parser will always fail.
