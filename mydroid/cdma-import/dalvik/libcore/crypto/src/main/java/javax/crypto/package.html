This package provides the classes and interfaces needed to define encryption algorithm,
keys' agreement algorithms and MAC (Message Authentication Code). Stream ciphers are supported
as well as asymmetric, symmetric, block ciphers.
With class {@link javax.crypto.SealedObject} a programmer can secure an object by
encrypting it with a supported cipher.
Not only MAC but also HMAC (Hash MAC) with sha-1 arr supported.

Ciphers' implementations from different providers ae easily integrated in the package thanks
to the SPI (Security Provider Interface) abstract classes.
