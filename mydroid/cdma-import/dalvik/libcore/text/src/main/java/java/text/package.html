  <p>
    The java.text package allows to uncouple the text in the
    application from a natural language.
  </p>
  <p>
    With this it is possible to write the application in an
    unlocalized way. Like this a new localization can be provided at any
    time without having to change anything in the code. Support for
    localization is given for numbers, messages, dates and also
    characteristics of a language like the directionality, sorting order or
    enumeration of characters, words or lines.
