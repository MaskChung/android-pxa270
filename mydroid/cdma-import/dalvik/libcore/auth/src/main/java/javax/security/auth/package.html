This package provides all the classes and interfaces needed to implemenet and program
different methods of users' authentification and role based users' authorization.
It integrates the previous separated JAAS package into the Java SDK.

All subjects' authentification and role based authorization are strongly coupled with
the java.security file that, as always, is the ultimate arbiter of all  matters secure in Java.
For example the class {@link javax.security.auth.SubjectDomainCombiner} updates the
ProtectionDomains associated with the actual class with the subjects defined therein.
