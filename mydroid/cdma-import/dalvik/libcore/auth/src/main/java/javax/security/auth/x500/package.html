This package provides all the classes  needed to store X.500 principals and their credentials.
The class {@link javax.security.auth.x500.X500Principal} represents such a principal.
Specifically, X500 principals are defined by such tokens (distinguished names) as O=Google,
 OU=Android, C=US.
 The class accepts string representations of distinguished names defined in both
 specifications RFC2253 and (the older) RFC1779. OID (Object Identifiers used to encode with
 the ASN.1 standard the extended attributes of distinguished name, algorithm etc.) must
 follow the RFC2459 specification.
