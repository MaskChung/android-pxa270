    Provides an implementation of regular expressions, which is useful for
    matching, searching, and replacing strings based on patterns. The two
    fundamental classes are {@link java.util.regex.Pattern} and
    {@link java.util.regex.Matcher}. The former
    takes a pattern described by means of a regular expression and compiles it
    into a special internal representation. The latter matches the compiled
    pattern against a given input.

    <h2>Regular expressions</h2>
    
    A regular expression consists of literal text, meta characters, character
    sets, and operators. The latter three have a special meaning when
    encountered during the processing of a pattern.
 
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="#metachars">Meta characters</a> are a special means to describe
        single characters in the input text. A common example for a meta
        character is the dot '.', which, when used in a regular expression,
        matches any character.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#charsets">Character sets</a> are a convenient means to
        describe different characters that match a single character in the
        input. Character sets are enclosed in angular brackets '[' and ']'
        and use the dash '-' for forming ranges. A typical example is
        "[0-9a-fA-F]", which describes the set of all hexadecimal digits.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#operators">Operators</a> modify or combine whole regular
        expressions, with the result being a regular expression again. An
        example for an operator is the asterisk '*', which, together with the
        regular expression preceding it, matches zero or more repetitions of
        that regular expression. The plus sign '+' is similar, but requires at
        least one occurrence.
      </li>
    </ul>
 
    Meta characters, the '[' and ']' that form a character set, and operators
    normally lose their special meaning when preceded by a backslash '\'. To get
    a backslash by itself, use a double backslash. Note that when using regular
    expressions in Java source code, some care has to be taken to get the
    backslashes right (due to yet another level of escaping being necessary for
    Java).
    
    <p>
    
    The following table gives some basic examples of regular expressions and
    input strings that match them:

    <h2>Implementation notes</h2>
    
    The regular expression implementation used in Android is provided by
    <a href="http://www.icu-project.org">ICU</a>. The notation for the regular
    expressions is mostly a superset of those used in other Java language
    implementations. This means that existing applications will normally work as
    expected, but in rare cases some regular expression content that is meant to
    be literal might be interpreted with a special meaning. The most notable
    examples are the single '&amp;', which can also be used as the intersection
    operator for <a href="#charsets">character sets</a>, and the intersection
    operators '-' and '--'. Also, some of the flags are handled in a
    slightly different way:
     
    <ul>
      <li>
        The {@link java.util.regex.Pattern#CASE_INSENSITIVE} flag silently
        assumes Unicode case-insensitivity. That is, the
        {@link java.util.regex.Pattern#UNICODE_CASE} flag is effectively a
        no-op. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The {@link java.util.regex.Pattern#CANON_EQ} flag is not supported at
        all (throws an exception).
      </li>
    </ul>
