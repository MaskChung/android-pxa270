      Provides buffers that help handling data.

    <p>
      There are buffers for most primitive data types such as
      FloatBuffer, IntBuffer, ... They all give means to put/get data from the
      buffers, to compact, slice or duplicate it, or to wrap an existing
      array. A buffer also manages the position of the current element in the
      buffer, lets you rewind to the beginning, skip elements or go to the
      last element.
