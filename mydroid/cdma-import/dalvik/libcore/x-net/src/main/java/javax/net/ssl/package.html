This package provides all the classes and interfaces needed to implemenet and program the Secure Socket
abstraction based on the SSL protocol SSSLv3.0 or TLSv1.2
All the details of the SSL handshake protocol ar card for, and the cipher set with which
a client or a server work can be specified.

X.509 certificates are verified and if desired either the client or the server can walk through
the whole certificates' chain until the root CA is reached.

Notice that the Android javax.net.ssl package uses the OpenSSL Library to implement the low level
SSL functionality. All the relevant OpenSSl write(...) and read(...) functions are hidden within two
JNI files. The signatures of all the Java SSL methods are compliant with that of the Java 5.0
specification.

The provider for all SSL cryptological tools is The Legion of Bouncy Castle (http://www.bouncycastle.org).
