</p><h2><a name="What_s_JNI_"> </a> What's JNI? </h2>
<p>

JNI is the Java Native Interface.  It defines a way for code written in the
Java programming language to interact with native
code, e.g. functions written in C/C++.  It's VM-neutral, has support for loading code from
dynamic shared libraries, and while cumbersome at times is reasonably efficient.
</p><p>
You really should read through the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/jniTOC.html">JNI spec for J2SE 1.6</a>
to understand how JNI works.  Some aspects of the spec aren't immediately obvious on
first reading, so you may find the next few sections handy.
The more detailed <i>JNI Programmer's Guide and Specification</i> can be found
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jni/html/jniTOC.html">here</a>.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="JavaVM_and_JNIEnv"> </a> JavaVM and JNIEnv </h2>
<p>
JNI defines two key data structures, "JavaVM" and "JNIEnv".  Both of these are essentially
pointers to pointers to function tables.  (In the C++ version, it's a class whose sole member
is a pointer to a function table.)  The JavaVM provides the "invocation interface" functions,
which allow you to create and destroy the VM.  In theory you can have multiple VMs per process,
but Android's VMs only allow one.
</p><p>
The JNIEnv provides most of the JNI functions.  Your native functions all receive a JNIEnv as
the first argument.
</p><p>

On some VMs, the JNIEnv is used for thread-local storage.  For this reason, <strong>you cannot share a JNIEnv between threads</strong>.
If a piece of code has no other way to get a JNIEnv, you should share
the JavaVM, and use JavaVM-&gt;GetEnv to discover the thread's JNIEnv.
</p><p>
The C and C++ definitions of JNIEnv and JavaVM are different.  "jni.h" provides different typedefs
depending on whether it's included into ".c" or ".cpp".  For this reason it's a bad idea to
include JNIEnv arguments in header files included by both languages.  (Put another way: if your
header file requires "#ifdef __cplusplus", you may have to do some extra work if anything in
that header refers to JNIEnv.)
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="jclassID_jmethodID_and_jfieldID"> jclassID, jmethodID, and jfieldID </a></h2>
<p>
If you want to access an object's field from native code, you would do the following:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> Get the class object reference for the class with <code>FindClass</code>
</li>
<li> Get the field ID for the field with <code>GetFieldID</code>
</li>
<li> Get the contents of the field with something appropriate, e.g.
<code>GetIntField</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Similarly, to call a method, you'd first get a class object reference and then a method ID.  The IDs are often just
pointers to internal VM data structures.  Looking them up may require several string
comparisons, but once you have them the actual call to get the field or invoke the method
is very quick.
</p><p>
If performance is important, it's useful to look the values up once and cache the results
in your native code.  Because we are limiting ourselves to one VM per process, it's reasonable
to store this data in a static local structure.
</p><p>
The class references, field IDs, and method IDs are guaranteed valid until the class is unloaded.  Classes
are only unloaded if all classes associated with a ClassLoader can be garbage collected,
which is rare but will not be impossible in our system.  The jclassID
is a class reference and <strong>must be protected</strong> with a call
to <code>NewGlobalRef</code> (see the next section).
</p><p>
If you would like to cache the IDs when a class is loaded, and automatically re-cache them
if the class is ever unloaded and reloaded, the correct way to initialize
the IDs is to add a piece of code that looks like this to the appropriate class:
</p><p>

</p><pre>    /*
     * We use a class initializer to allow the native code to cache some
     * field offsets.
     */

    /*
     * A native function that looks up and caches interesting
     * class/field/method IDs for this class.  Returns false on failure.
     */
    native private static boolean nativeClassInit();
 
    /*
     * Invoke the native initializer when the class is loaded.
     */
    static {
        if (!nativeClassInit())
            throw new RuntimeException("native init failed");
    }
</pre>
<p>
Create a nativeClassInit method in your C/C++ code that performs the ID lookups.  The code
will be executed once, when the class is initialized.  If the class is ever unloaded and
then reloaded, it will be executed again.  (See the implementation of java.io.FileDescriptor
for an example in our source tree.)
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="local_vs_global_references"> Local vs. Global References </a></h2>
<p>
Every object that JNI returns is a "local reference".  This means that it's valid for the
duration of the current native method in the current thread.
<strong>Even if the object itself continues to live on after the native method returns, the reference is not valid.</strong>
This applies to all sub-classes of jobject, including jclass and jarray.
(Dalvik VM will warn you about this when -Xcheck:jni is enabled.)
</p><p>

If you want to hold on to a reference for a longer period, you must use a "global" reference.
The <code>NewGlobalRef</code> function takes the local reference as
an argument and returns a global one:

<p><pre>jobject* localRef = [...];
jobject* globalRef;
globalRef = env-&gt;NewGlobalRef(localRef);
</pre>

The global reference is guaranteed to be valid until you call
<code>DeleteGlobalRef</code>.
</p><p>
All JNI methods accept both local and global references as arguments.
</p><p>
Programmers are required to "not excessively allocate" local references.  In practical terms this means
that if you're creating large numbers of local references, perhaps while running through an array of
Objects, you should free them manually with
<code>DeleteLocalRef</code> instead of letting JNI do it for you.  The
VM is only required to reserve slots for
16 local references, so if you need more than that you should either delete as you go or use
<code>EnsureLocalCapacity</code> to reserve more.
</p><p>
Note: method and field IDs are just 32-bit identifiers, not object
references, and should not be passed to <code>NewGlobalRef</code>.  The raw data
pointers returned by functions like <code>GetStringUTFChars</code>
and <code>GetByteArrayElements</code> are also not objects.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="UTF_8_and_UTF_16_strings"> </a> UTF-8 and UTF-16 Strings </h2>
<p>
The Java programming language uses UTF-16.  For convenience, JNI provides methods that work with "modified UTF-8" encoding
as well.  (Some VMs use the modified UTF-8 internally to store strings; ours do not.)  The
modified encoding only supports the 8- and 16-bit forms, and stores ASCII NUL values in a 16-bit encoding.
The nice thing about it is that you can count on having C-style zero-terminated strings,
suitable for use with standard libc string functions.  The down side is that you cannot pass
arbitrary UTF-8 data into the VM and expect it to work correctly.
</p><p>
It's usually best to operate with UTF-16 strings.  With our current VMs, the
<code>GetStringChars</code> method
does not require a copy, whereas <code>GetStringUTFChars</code> requires a malloc and a UTF conversion.  Note that
<strong>UTF-16 strings are not zero-terminated</strong>, so you need to hang on to the string length as well as
the string pointer.

</p><p>
<strong>Don't forget to Release the strings you Get</strong>.  The string functions return <code>jchar*</code> or <code>jbyte*</code>, which
are pointers to primitive types rather than local references.  They are not automatically released
when the native method returns.
</p><p>
</p><p>


</p><h2><a name="Arrays"> </a> Primitive Arrays </h2>
<p>
JNI provides functions for accessing the contents of array objects.
While arrays of objects must be accessed one entry at a time, arrays of
primitives can be read and written directly as if they were declared in C.
</p><p>
To make the interface as efficient as possible without constraining
the VM implementation,
the <code>Get&lt;PrimitiveType&gt;ArrayElements</code> family of calls
allows the VM to either return a pointer to the actual elements, or
allocate some memory and make a copy.  Either way, the raw pointer returned
is guaranteed to be valid until the corresponding <code>Release</code> call
is issued (which implies that, if the data wasn't copied, the array object
will be pinned down and can't be relocated as part of compacting the heap).
</p><p>
You can determine whether or not the data was copied by passing in a
non-NULL pointer for the <code>isCopy</code> argument.  This is rarely
useful.
</p><p>
The <code>Release</code> call takes a <code>mode</code> argument that can
have one of three values.  The actions performed by the VM depend upon
whether or not the data was copied:
<ul>
    <li><code>0</code>
    <ul>
        <li>Copy: data is copied back.  The buffer with the copy is freed.
        <li>No copy: the array object is un-pinned.
    </ul>
    <li><code>JNI_COMMIT</code>
    <ul>
        <li>Copy: data is copied back.  The buffer with the copy is NOT freed.
        <li>No copy: does nothing.
    </ul>
    <li><code>JNI_ABORT</code>
    <ul>
        <li>Copy: the buffer with the copy is freed; any changes to it are lost.
        <li>No copy: the array object is un-pinned.  Earlier
        writes are NOT aborted.
    </ul>
</ul>
</p><p>
One reason for checking the <code>isCopy</code> flag is to know if
you need to call <code>Release</code> with <code>JNI_COMMIT</code>
after making changes to an array -- if you're alternating between making
changes and executing code that uses the contents of the array, you can
skip the no-op commit.  Another possible reason for checking the flag is for
efficient handling of <code>JNI_ABORT</code>.  For example, you might want
to get an array, modify it in place, pass pieces to other functions, and
then discard the changes.  If you know that JNI is making a new copy for
you, there's no need to create another "editable" copy.  If JNI is passing
you the original, then you do need to make your own copy.
</p><p>
Some have asserted that you can skip the <code>Release</code> call if
<code>*isCopy</code> is false.  This is not the case.  If no copy buffer was
allocated, then the original memory must be pinned down and can't be moved by
the garbage collector.
</p><p>
Also note that the <code>JNI_COMMIT</code> flag does NOT release the array,
and you will need to call <code>Release</code> again with a different flag
eventually.
</p><p>
</p><p>


</p><h2><a name="Exceptions"> Exceptions </a></h2>
<p>
You may not call most JNI functions when an exception is pending.  Your code is expected to
see the exception (via <code>ExceptionCheck()</code> or <code>ExceptionOccurred()</code>) and return,
or clear the exception and handle it.
</p><p>
The only JNI functions that you are allowed to call while an exception is
pending are listed <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/design.html#wp17626">
    here</a>.
</p><p>
Note that exceptions thrown by interpreted code do not "leap over" native code,
and exceptions through by native code don't longjmp back into the interpreter.  The
JNI <code>Throw</code> and <code>ThrowNew</code> instructions just
set an exception pointer in the
current thread.  Upon returning from native code, the exception will be noted and
handled appropriately.
</p><p>
Native code can "catch" an exception by calling <code>ExceptionCheck</code> or
<code>ExceptionOccurred</code>, and clear it with
<code>ExceptionClear</code>.  As usual,
discarding exceptions without handling them can lead to problems.
</p><p>
There are no built-in functions for manipulating the Throwable object
itself, so if you want to (say) get the exception string you will need to
find the Throwable class, look up the method ID for
<code>getMessage "()Ljava/lang/String;"</code>, invoke it, and if the result
is non-NULL use <code>GetStringUTFChars</code> to get something you can
hand to printf or a LOG macro.

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="Extended_checking"> Extended Checking </a></h2>
<p>
JNI does very little error checking.  Calling <code>SetFieldInt</code>
on an Object field will succeed.  The
goal is to minimize the overhead on the assumption that, if you've written it in native code,
you probably did it for performance reasons.
</p><p>
Some VMs support extended checking with the "<code>-Xcheck:jni</code>" flag.  If the flag is set, the VM
puts a different table of functions into the JavaVM and JNIEnv pointers.  These functions do
an extended series of checks before calling the standard implementation.

</p><p>
Some things that may be verified:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> Check for null pointers where not allowed.
<li>
<li> Verify argument type correctness (jclass is a class object,
jfieldID points to field data, jstring is a java.lang.String).
</li>
<li> Field type correctness, e.g. don't store a HashMap in a String field.
</li>
<li> Check to see if an exception is pending on calls where pending exceptions are not legal.
</li>
<li> Check for calls to inappropriate functions between Critical get/release calls.
</li>
<li> Check that JNIEnv structs aren't being shared between threads.

</li>
<li> Make sure local references aren't used outside their allowed lifespan.
</li>
<li> UTF-8 strings contain valid "modified UTF-8" data.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Accessibility of methods and fields (i.e. public vs. private) is not
checked.
<p>
The Dalvik VM supports the <code>-Xcheck:jni</code> flag.  For a
description of how to enable it for Android apps, see
<a href="embedded-vm-control.html">Controlling the Embedded VM</a>.
It's currently enabled by default in the Android emulator.

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="Native_Libraries"> Native Libraries </a></h2>
<p>
You can load native code from shared libraries with the standard
<code>System.loadLibrary()</code> call.  The
preferred way to get at your native code is:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> Call <code>System.loadLibrary()</code> from a static class initializer.  (See the earlier example, where one is used to call nativeClassInit().)  The argument is the "undecorated" library name, e.g. to load "libfubar.so" you would pass in "fubar".

</li>
<li> Provide a native function: <code><b>jint JNI_OnLoad(JavaVM* vm, void* reserved)</b></code>
</li>
<li> In JNI_OnLoad, register all of your native methods.  You should declare the methods "static" so the names don't occupy space in the symbol table on the device.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For a simple example, see <code>//device/tests/jnilibtest/JniLibTest.c</code>
and <code>//device/apps/AndroidTests/src/com/android/unit_tests/JniLibTest.java</code>.
</p><p>
You can also call <code>System.load()</code> with the full path name of the
shared library.  This is not recommended for Android apps, since the
installation directory could change in the future.
</p><p>


</p><h2><a name="Unsupported"> Unsupported Features </a></h2>
<p>All JNI 1.6 features are supported, with the following exceptions:
<ul>
    <li><code>DefineClass</code> is not implemented.  Dalvik does not use
    Java bytecodes or class files, so passing in binary class data
    doesn't work.  Translation facilities may be added in a future
    version of the VM.</li>
    <li><code>NewWeakGlobalRef</code> and <code>DeleteWeakGlobalRef</code>
    are not implemented.  The
    VM supports weak references, but not JNI "weak global" references.
    These will be supported in a future release.</li>
    <li><code>GetObjectRefType</code> (new in 1.6) is implemented but not fully
    functional -- it can't always tell the difference between "local" and
    "global" references.</li>
</ul>
