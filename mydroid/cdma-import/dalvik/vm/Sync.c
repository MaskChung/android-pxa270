/*
 * Fundamental synchronization mechanisms.
 *
 * The top part of the file has operations on "monitor" structs; the
 * next part has the native calls on objects.
 *
 * The current implementation uses "thin locking" to avoid allocating
 * an Object's full Monitor struct until absolutely necessary (i.e.,
 * during contention or a call to wait()).
 *
 * TODO: make improvements to thin locking
 * We may be able to improve performance and reduce memory requirements by:
 *  - reverting to a thin lock once the Monitor is no longer necessary
 *  - using a pool of monitor objects, with some sort of recycling scheme
 *
 * TODO: recycle native-level monitors when objects are garbage collected.
 *
 * NOTE: if we broadcast a notify, and somebody sneaks in a Thread.interrupt
 * before the notify finishes (i.e. before all threads sleeping on the
 * condition variable have awoken), we could end up with a nonzero value for
 * "notifying" after everybody is gone because one of the notified threads
 * will actually exit via the "interrupted" path.  This can be detected as
 * (notifying + interrupting > waiting), i.e. the number of threads that need
 * to be woken is greater than the number waiting.  The fix is to test and
 * adjust "notifying" at the start of the wait() call.
 * -> This is probably not a problem if we notify less than the full set
 * before the interrupt comes in.  If we have four waiters, two pending
 * notifies, and an interrupt hits, we will interrupt one thread and notify
 * two others.  Doesn't matter if the interrupted thread would have been
 * one of the notified.  Count is only screwed up if we have two waiters,
 * in which case it's safe to fix it at the start of the next wait().

/*
 * Every Object has a monitor associated with it, but not every Object is
 * actually locked.  Even the ones that are locked do not need a
 * full-fledged monitor until a) there is actual contention or b) wait()
 * is called on the Object.
 *
 * For Dalvik, we have implemented a scheme similar to the one described
 * in Bacon et al.'s "Thin locks: featherweight synchronization for Java"
 * (ACM 1998).  Things are even easier for us, though, because we have
 * a full 32 bits to work with.
 *
 * The two states that an Object's lock may have are referred to as
 * "thin" and "fat".  The lock may transition between the two states
 * for various reasons.
 *
 * The lock value itself is stored in Object.lock, which is a union of
 * the form:
 *
 *     typedef union Lock {
 *         u4          thin;
 *         Monitor*    mon;
 *     } Lock;
 *
 * It is possible to tell the current state of the lock from the actual
 * value, so we do not need to store any additional state.  When the
 * lock is "thin", it has the form:
 *
 *     [31 ---- 16] [15 ---- 1] [0]
 *      lock count   thread id   1
 *
 * When it is "fat", the field is simply a (Monitor *).  Since the pointer
 * will always be 4-byte-aligned, bits 1 and 0 will always be zero when
 * the field holds a pointer.  Hence, we can tell the current fat-vs-thin
 * state by checking the least-significant bit.
 *
 * For an in-depth description of the mechanics of thin-vs-fat locking,
 * read the paper referred to above.
 *
 * To reduce the amount of work when attempting a compare and exchange,
 * Thread.threadId is guaranteed to have bit 0 set, and all new Objects
 * have their lock fields initialized to the value 0x1, or
 * DVM_LOCK_INITIAL_THIN_VALUE, via DVM_OBJECT_INIT().
 */

/*
 * Monitors provide:
 *  - mutually exclusive access to resources
 *  - a way for multiple threads to wait for notification
 *
 * In effect, they fill the role of both mutexes and condition variables.
 *
 * Only one thread can own the monitor at any time.  There may be several
 * threads waiting on it (the wait call unlocks it).  One or more waiting
 * threads may be getting interrupted or notified at any given time.

#ifdef WITH_DEADLOCK_PREDICTION
/*
 * ===========================================================================
 *      Deadlock prediction
 * ===========================================================================
 */
/*
The idea is to predict the possibility of deadlock by recording the order
in which monitors are acquired.  If we see an attempt to acquire a lock
out of order, we can identify the locks and offending code.

To make this work, we need to keep track of the locks held by each thread,
and create history trees for each lock.  When a thread tries to acquire
a new lock, we walk through the "history children" of the lock, looking
for a match with locks the thread already holds.  If we find a match,
it means the thread has made a request that could result in a deadlock.

To support recursive locks, we always allow re-locking a currently-held
lock, and maintain a recursion depth count.

An ASCII-art example, where letters represent Objects:

        A
       /|\
      / | \
     B  |  D
      \ |
       \|
        C

The above is the tree we'd have after handling Object synchronization
sequences "ABC", "AC", "AD".  A has three children, {B, C, D}.  C is also
a child of B.  (The lines represent pointers between parent and child.
Every node can have multiple parents and multiple children.)

If we hold AC, and want to lock B, we recursively search through B's
children to see if A or C appears.  It does, so we reject the attempt.
(A straightforward way to implement it: add a link from C to B, then
determine whether the graph starting at B contains a cycle.)

If we hold AC and want to lock D, we would succeed, creating a new link
from C to D.

The lock history and a stack trace is attached to the Object's Monitor
struct, which means we need to fatten every Object we lock (thin locking
is effectively disabled).  If we don't need the stack trace we can
avoid fattening the leaf nodes, only fattening objects that need to hold
history trees.

Updates to Monitor structs are only allowed for the thread that holds
the Monitor, so we actually do most of our deadlock prediction work after
the lock has been acquired.

When an object with a monitor is GCed, we need to remove it from the
history trees.  There are two basic approaches:
 (1) For through the entire set of known monitors, search all child
     lists for the object in question.  This is rather slow, resulting
     in GC passes that take upwards of 10 seconds to complete.
 (2) Maintain "parent" pointers in each node.  Remove the entries as
     required.  This requires additional storage and maintenance for
     every operation, but is significantly faster at GC time.
For each GCed object, we merge all of the object's children into each of
the object's parents.
