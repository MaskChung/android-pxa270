You have tried to change the API from what has been previously approved.

To make these errors go away, you have two choices:
   1) You can add "@hide" javadoc comments to the methods, etc. listed in the
      errors above.

   2) You can update current.xml by executing the following commands:

         p4 edit config/api/current.xml
         make update-api

      To check in the revised current.xml, you will need OWNERS approval.
