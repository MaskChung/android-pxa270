# grxmlcompile -par baseline11k.par -grxml bothtags5.grxml 
# make_g2g -base bothtags5,addWords=100 -out bothtags5.g2g 
# grxmlcompile -par baseline11k.par -grxml enroll.grxml
# make_g2g -base enroll -out enroll.g2g
#
# now from the srec/config/en.us directory run the script with the following command line:
#
# /system/bin/SRecTest -parfile baseline11k.par -tcp tcp/bothtags5.tcp -datapath audio/ >out_SHIP_bothtags5.txt 2>&1
#
# VOICETAGS PREPARATION
# let's load up the voice-enrollment "grammar" and refer to it as "ve" later
# ROOT is the name of the rule we activate in that grammar, no other rule should work anyways
context_load  grammars/bothtags5.g2g  BothTags   trash  not_ve
context_load  grammars/enroll.g2g VoiceEnroll ROOT ve

#
# VOICETAGS
# the pattern for voicetags is :
# (1) the we loadup the voice-enrollment grammar
# (2) the user utters the training token for the "voicetag" (sometimes loosely called nametag)
# (3) the voicetag "recognition result" from that training token is then added to a list of tags (for saving to disk)n
# (4) the voicetag is also added to the primary recognition grammar

# TEXTTAGS
# The pattern for texttags is that we just add the texttag
# since pronunciation guessing is not always available we're specifying
# the pronunciation to be used for this text tag.
# If NULL appears in the transcription field (immediately after the name)
# then the phonetic transcription will be requested from the G2P
# (Grapheme-to-Phoneme) module at runtime.
