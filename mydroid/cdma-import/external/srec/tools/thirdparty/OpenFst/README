OpenFst - Beta release version.  
http://128.122.80.210/~openfst/twiki/pub/FST/FstDownload
OpenFst-beta-20070801.tgz

PLATFORMS:

  This version is known to work under linux using g++.
  The make files are unlikely to work on other platforms
  unmodified. Stay tuned for an autoconf build.
	
BUILDING:

  To build (rudimentary Makefiles for now):

    cd fst ; make all

  To test:

    cd fst ; make test
    # Note long compile on algo_test and pair-arc.so (many templates)

USING WITH YOUR OWN PROGRAMS:

  Include "fst/lib/fstlib.h" (path must be relative to the OpenFst root
  directory). You need to link to fst/lib/libfst.so as well as libpthread
  and libdl. The linking is dynamic so that the Fst and Arc tpe
  DSO extensions can be used (see e.g. test/dso_test.sh).

DOCUMENTATION: 

  At www.openfst.org.

TO DO:
  1) remove/sanitize google-isms - e.g. flags and error handling in compat.*
  2) autoconf
  3) check portability
