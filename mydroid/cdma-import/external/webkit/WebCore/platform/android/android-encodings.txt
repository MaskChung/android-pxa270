# The items on the left are names of TextEncodingID values
# The items on the right are IANA character set names. Names listed in character-sets.txt are not
# repeated here; mentioning any one character set from a group in there pulls in all the aliases in
# that group.

# XXX: This needs to be kept in sync with AndroidUnicode.h in utils.
# XXX: These are not the supported encodings, they are just the available encodings
#      that WebCore will recognize. Support is determined by carriers.
