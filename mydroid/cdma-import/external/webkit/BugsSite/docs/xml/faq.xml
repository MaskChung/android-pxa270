        <answer>
          <para>
            We can't find any head-to-head comparisons of Bugzilla against
            other defect-tracking software. If you know of one, please get
            in touch. In the experience of Matthew Barnson (the original
            author of this FAQ), though, Bugzilla offers superior
            performance on commodity hardware, better price (free!), more
            developer-friendly features (such as stored queries, email
            integration, and platform independence), improved scalability,
            greater flexibility, and superior ease-of-use when compared
            to commercial bug-tracking software.

            software, and would like to submit a list of advantages your
            product has over Bugzilla, simply send it to 
            <email>documentation@bugzilla.org</email> and we'd be happy to
            include the comparison in our documentation.

            Why doesn't Bugzilla offer this or that feature or compatibility

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you
            have not yet found it. While Bugzilla makes strides in usability,
            customizability, scalability, and user interface with each release,
            that doesn't mean it can't still use improvement!

            The best way to make an enhancement request is to <ulink 
            url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Bugzilla">file
            a bug at bugzilla.mozilla.org</ulink> and set the Severity
            to 'enhancement'. Your 'request for enhancement' (RFE) will
            start out in the UNCONFIRMED state, and will stay there until
            someone with the ability to COMFIRM the bug reviews it.
            If that person feels it to be a good request that fits in with
            Bugzilla's overall direction, the status will be changed to
            NEW; if not, they will probably explain why and set the bug
            to RESOLVED/WONTFIX. If someone else has made the same (or
            almost the same) request before, your request will be marked
            RESOLVED/DUPLICATE, and a pointer to the previous RFE will be
            added.
          </para>
          <para>
            Even if your RFE gets approved, that doesn't mean it's going
            to make it right into the next release; there are a limited
            number of developers, and a whole lot of RFEs... some of
            which are <emphasis>quite</emphasis> complex. If you're a
            code-hacking sort of person, you can help the project along
            by making a patch yourself that supports the functionality
            you require. If you have never contributed anything to
            Bugzilla before, please be sure to read the 
            <ulink url="http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/developer.html">Developers' Guide</ulink>
            and

        <question id="faq-general-mysql">
          <para>
            Why MySQL?  I'm interested in seeing Bugzilla run on
            PostgreSQL/Sybase/Oracle/Msql/MSSQL.
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            MySQL was originally chosen because it is free, easy to install,
            and was available for the hardware Netscape intended to run it on.
          </para>
          <para>
            There is currently work in progress to make Bugzilla work on
            PostgreSQL; track the progress of this initiative in <ulink
            url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98304">bug 98304</ulink>.
          </para>
          <para>
            Sybase support is no longer being worked on.  Even if it eventually
            happens, it's VERY unlikely to work without the end-user-company
            having to stick a few developers on making several manual changes.
            Sybase is just NOT very standards-compliant (despite all the hype),
            and it turned out that way too much had to be changed to make it
            work -- like moving half of the application logic into stored
            procedures to get any kind of decent performance out of it.

            Red Hat once ran a version of Bugzilla that worked on Oracle, 
            but that was long, long ago; that version (Bugzilla 2.8) is
            now obsolete, insecure, and totally unsupported. Red Hat's
            current Bugzilla (based on Bugzilla 2.17.1) uses PostgreSQL,
            and work is being done to merge those changes into the main
            distribution. (See above.) At this time we know of no recent
            ports of Bugzilla to Oracle. (In our honest opinion, Bugzilla
            doesn't need what Oracle offers.)

        <question id="faq-general-bonsaitools">
          <para>
            What is <filename>/usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl</filename>?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Bugzilla used to have the path to perl on the shebang line set
            to <filename>/usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl</filename> because when
            Terry first started writing the code for mozilla.org he needed a
            version of Perl and other tools that were completely under his
            control. This location was abandoned for the 2.18 release in favor
            of the more sensible <filename>/usr/bin/perl</filename>. If you
            installed an older verion of Bugzilla and created the symlink we
            suggested, you can remove it now (provided that you don't have
            anything else, such as Bonsai, using it and you don't intend to
            reinstall an older version of Bugzilla).

        <question id="faq-general-perlpath">
          <para>
            My perl is located at <filename>/usr/local/bin/perl</filename>
            and not <filename>/usr/bin/perl</filename>. Is there an easy
            to change that in all the files that have this hard-coded?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            The easiest way to get around this is to create a link from
            one to the other:
            <command>ln -s /usr/local/bin/perl /usr/bin/perl</command>.
            If that's not an option for you, the following bit of perl
            magic will change all the shebang lines (that is to say,
            the line at the top of each file that starts with '#!' 
            and contains the path) to something else:
          </para>
          <programlisting>
perl -pi -e 's@#\!/usr/bin/perl@#\!/usr/local/bin/perl@' *cgi *pl
          </programlisting>
          <para>
            Sadly, this command-line won't work on Windows unless you
            also have Cygwin. However, MySQL comes with a binary called
            <command>replace</command> which can do the job:
          </para>
          <programlisting>
C:\mysql\bin\replace "#!/usr/bin/perl" "#!C:\perl\bin\perl" -- *.cgi *.pl
          </programlisting>
          <note>
            <para>
              If your perl path is something else again, just follow the
              above examples and replace
              <filename>/usr/local/bin/perl</filename> with your own perl path.
            </para>            
          </note>
          <para>
            Once you've modified all your files, you'll also need to modify the
            <filename>t/002goodperl.t</filename> test, as it tests that all
            shebang lines are equal to <filename>/usr/bin/perl</filename>.
            (For more information on the test suite, please check out the 
            appropriate section in the <ulink
            url="http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/developer.html#testsuite">Developers'
            Guide</ulink>.) Having done this, run the test itself:
            <programlisting>
perl runtests.pl 2 --verbose
            </programlisting>
            to ensure that you've modified all the relevant files.
          </para>
          <para>
            If using Apache on Windows, you can avoid the whole problem
            by setting the <ulink
            url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#scriptinterpretersource">
            ScriptInterpreterSource</ulink> directive to 'Registry'.
            (If using Apache 2 or higher, set it to 'Registry-Strict'.)
            ScriptInterperterSource requires a registry entry
            <quote>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.cgi\Shell\ExecCGI\Command</quote> to
            associate .cgi files with your perl executable. If one does
            not already exist, create it with a default value of
           <quote>&lt;full path to perl&gt; -T</quote>, e.g.
           <quote>C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -T</quote>.

          <para>
            Yes. However, modifying some fields, notably those related to bug

            beware that giving direct access to the database does contain some
            security implications. Even if you give read-only access to the

                to allow Bugzilla to record responses to mail with the
                associated bug, you may need to caution your users to set
                their mailer to <quote>respond to messages in the format in
                which they were sent</quote>. For security reasons Bugzilla
                ignores HTML tags in comments, and if a user sends HTML-based
                email into Bugzilla the resulting comment looks downright awful.

            could that template be imported into <quote>matching</quote>
            fields? If I wanted to take the results of a query and export
            that data to MS Excel, could I do that?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Bugzilla can output buglists as HTML (the default), CSV or RDF.
            The link for CSV can be found at the bottom of the buglist in HTML
            format. This CSV format can easily be imported into MS Excel or
            other spreadsheet applications.
          </para>
          <para>
            To use the RDF format of the buglist it is necessary to append a
            <computeroutput>&amp;ctype=rdf</computeroutput> to the URL. RDF
            is meant to be machine readable and thus it is assumed that the
            URL would be generated programmatically so there is no user visible
            link to this format.
          </para>
          <para>
            Currently the only script included with Bugzilla that can import
            data is <filename>importxml.pl</filename> which is intended to be
            used for importing the data generated by the XML ctype of
            <filename>show_bug.cgi</filename> in association with bug moving.
            Any other use is left as an exercise for the user.

          <para>
            There are also scripts included in the <filename>contrib/</filename>

            educational purposes.

            Yes, but commits to the database must wait until the tables

            and backups routinely take less than a minute. If your database
            is larger, you may want to look into alternate backup
            techniques, such as database replication, or backing up from
            a read-only mirror. (Read up on these in the MySQL docs

          <para>
            I have a user who doesn't want to receive any more email
            from Bugzilla. How do I stop it entirely for this user?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            The user can stop Bugzilla from sending any mail by unchecking
            all boxes on the 'Edit prefs' -> 'Email settings' page.
            (As of 2.18,this is made easier by the addition of a 'Disable
            All Mail' button.) Alternately, you can add their email address
            to the <filename>data/nomail</filename> file (one email address
            per line). This will override their personal preferences, and
            they will never be sent mail again.

            There is no facility in Bugzilla itself to do this. It's also

            <command>mysql</command> command line utility to manually insert,
            delete and modify table information. There are also more intuitive
            GUI clients available. Personal favorites of the Bugzilla team

        <answer>
          <para>
            Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs.
            Synchronization will only work one way -- you can create
            a read-only copy of the database at one site, and have it
            regularly updated at intervals from the main database.
          </para>
          <para>
            MySQL has some synchronization features built-in to the
            latest releases. It would be great if someone looked into
            the possibilities there and provided a report to the
            newsgroup on how to effectively synchronize two Bugzilla

            Seriously though, making Bugzilla work easily with Windows

            necessary components are in place (perl, a webserver, an MTA, etc.)
            then installation of Bugzilla on a Windows box should be no more

            Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to
            configure the Web server to treat *.cgi files as CGI scripts.
            In IIS, you do this by adding *.cgi to the App Mappings with
            the &lt;path&gt;\perl.exe %s %s as the executable.

                for the script file(s) to the executable for the script
                interpreter. For example, you might map the extension .py to
                Python.exe, the executable for the Python script interpreter.
                Note For the ActiveState Perl script interpreter, the extension
                '.pl' is associated with PerlIS.dll by default. If you want
                to change the association of .pl to perl.exe, you need to
                change the application mapping. In the mapping, you must add
                two percent (%) characters to the end of the pathname for
                perl.exe, as shown in this example:

          <para>
            The query page is very confusing.
            Isn't there a simpler way to query?

          <para>
            The interface was simplified by a UI designer for 2.16. Further
            suggestions for improvement are welcome, but we won't sacrifice
            power for simplicity.
          </para>
          <para>
            As of 2.18, there is also a 'simpler' search available. At the top
            of the search page are two links; <quote>Advanced Search</quote>
            will take you to the familiar full-power/full-complexity search
            page. The <quote>Find a Specific Bug</quote> link will take you
            to a much-simplified page where you can pick a product and
            status (open,closed, or both), then enter words that appear in
            the bug you want to find. This search will scour the 'Summary'
            and 'Comment' fields, and return a list of bugs sorted so that
            the bugs with the most hits/matches are nearer to the top.
          </para>
          <note>
            <para>
              Matches in the Summary will 'trump' matches in comments,
              and bugs with summary-matches will be placed higher in
              the buglist --  even if a lower-ranked bug has more matches
              in the comments section.
            </para>
          </note>
          <para>
            Bugzilla uses a cookie to remember which version of the page
            you visited last, and brings that page up when you next do a
            search. The default page for new users (or after an upgrade)
            is the 'simple' search.

            I'm confused by the behavior of the <quote>Accept</quote>
            button in the Show Bug form. Why doesn't it assign the bug

            The current behavior is acceptable to bugzilla.mozilla.org and
            most users. If you want to change this behavior, though, you
            have your choice of patches:

            These patches are all somewhat dated now, and cannot be applied
            directly, but they are simple enough to provide a guide on how

            In the Bugzilla administrator UI, edit the keyword and
            it will let you replace the old keyword name with a new one.
            This will cause a problem with the keyword cache; run

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Simple answer; you can.
          </para>

          <para>
            The logic behind the page checks every bug in the list to
            determine legal state changes, and then only shows you controls
            to do things that could apply to <emphasis>every</emphasis> bug
            on the list. The reason for this is that if you try to do something
            illegal to a bug, the whole process will grind to a halt, and all
            changes after the failed one will <emphasis>also</emphasis> fail.
            Since that isn't a good outcome, the page doesn't even present
            you with the option.
          </para>

          <para>
            In practical terms, that means that in order to mark
            multiple bugs as CLOSED, then every bug on the page has to be
            either RESOLVED or VERIFIED already; if this is not the case,
            then the option to close the bugs will not appear on the page.
          </para>

          <para>
            The rationale is that if you pick one of the bugs that's not
            VERIFIED and try to CLOSE it, the bug change will fail
            miserably (thus killing any changes in the list after it
            while doing the bulk change) so it doesn't even give you the
            choice.

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Gerv and Myk suggest a 2-space indent, with embedded code sections on
            their own line, in line with outer tags. Like this:</para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[
<fred>
[% IF foo %]
  <bar>
  [% FOREACH x = barney %]
    <tr>
      <td>
        [% x %]
      </td>
    <tr>
  [% END %]
[% END %]
</fred>
]]></programlisting>

        <para> Myk also recommends you turn on PRE_CHOMP in the template
        initialization to prevent bloating of HTML with unnecessary whitespace.
        </para>

        <para>Please note that many have differing opinions on this subject,
        and the existing templates in Bugzilla espouse both this and a 4-space
        style. Either is acceptable; the above is preferred.</para>
