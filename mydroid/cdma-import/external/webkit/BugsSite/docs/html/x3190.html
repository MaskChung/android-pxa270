>First, make sure cookies are enabled in the user's browser.

>If that doesn't fix the problem, it may be that the user's ISP
     implements a rotating proxy server. This causes the user's effective IP
     address (the address which the Bugzilla server perceives him coming from)
     to change periodically. Since Bugzilla cookies are tied to a specific IP
     address, each time the effective address changes, the user will have to
     log in again.
     </P

>If you are using 2.18 (or later), there is a
     parameter called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loginnetmask"</SPAN
>, which you can use to set
     the number of bits of the user's IP address to require to be matched when
     authenticating the cookies. If you set this to something less than 32,
     then the user will be given a checkbox for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Restrict this login to
     my IP address"</SPAN
> on the login screen, which defaults to checked. If
     they leave the box checked, Bugzilla will behave the same as it did
     before, requiring an exact match on their IP address to remain logged in.
     If they uncheck the box, then only the left side of their IP address (up
     to the number of bits you specified in the parameter) has to match to
     remain logged in.
