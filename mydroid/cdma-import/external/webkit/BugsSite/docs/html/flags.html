>&#13;      A flag is a kind of status that can be set on bugs or attachments
      to indicate that the bugs/attachments are in a certain state.
      Each installation can define its own set of flags that can be set
      on bugs or attachments.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If your installation has defined a flag, you can set or unset that flag,
      and if your administrator has enabled requesting of flags, you can submit
      a request for another user to set the flag.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      To set a flag, select either "+" or "-" from the drop-down menu next to
      the name of the flag in the "Flags" list.  The meaning of these values are
      flag-specific and thus cannot be described in this documentation,
      but by way of example, setting a flag named "review" to "+" may indicate
      that the bug/attachment has passed review, while setting it to "-"
      may indicate that the bug/attachment has failed review.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      To unset a flag, click its drop-down menu and select the blank value.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If your administrator has enabled requests for a flag, request a flag
      by selecting "?" from the drop-down menu and then entering the username
      of the user you want to set the flag in the text field next to the menu.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      A set flag appears in bug reports and on "edit attachment" pages with the
      abbreviated username of the user who set the flag prepended to the
      flag name. For example, if Jack sets a "review" flag to "+", it appears
      as Jack: review [ + ]
    </P
><P
>&#13;      A requested flag appears with the user who requested the flag prepended
      to the flag name and the user who has been requested to set the flag
      appended to the flag name within parentheses.  For example, if Jack
      asks Jill for review, it appears as Jack: review [ ? ] (Jill).
    </P
><P
>&#13;      You can browse through open requests made of you and by you by selecting
      'My Requests' from the footer. You can also look at open requests limited
      by other requesters, requestees, products, components, and flag names from
      this page. Note that you can use '-' for requestee to specify flags with
      'no requestee' set.
