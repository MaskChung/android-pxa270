>&#13;     Flags are a way to attach a specific status to a bug or attachment, 
     either <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"+"</SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"-"</SPAN

     the flag itself, but contextually they could mean pass/fail, 
     accept/reject, approved/denied, or even a simple yes/no. If your site
     allows requestable flags, then users may set a flag to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"?"</SPAN
> as a 
     request to another user that they look at the bug/attachment, and set
     the flag to its correct status.

>&#13;            Once you delete a flag, it is <EM

            your Bugzilla. All the data for that flag will be deleted.
            Everywhere that flag was set, it will disappear,
            and you cannot get that data back. If you want to keep flag data,
            but don't want anybody to set any new flags or change current flags,
            unset <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
