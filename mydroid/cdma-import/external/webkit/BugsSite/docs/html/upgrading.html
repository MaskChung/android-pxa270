>&#13;      Upgrading Bugzilla is something we all want to do from time to time,
      be it to get new features or pick up the latest security fix. How easy
      it is to update depends on a few factors:

CLASS="section"
><A
NAME="upgrading-version-defns"
>3.11.1. Version Definitions</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;        Bugzilla displays the version you are using at the top of most
        pages you load. It will look something like '2.16.7' or '2.18rc3'
        or '2.19.1+'. The first number in this series is the Major Version.
        This does not change very often (that is to say, almost never);
        Bugzilla was 1.x.x when it was first created, and went to 2.x.x
        when it was re-written in perl in Sept 1998. If/When the major version
        is changed to 3.x.x, it will signify a significant structural change
        and will be accompanied by much fanfare and many instructions on
        how to upgrade, including a revision to this page. :)
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The second number in the version is called the 'minor number', and
        a release that changes the minor number is called a 'point release'.
        An even number in this position (2.14, 2.16, 2.18, 2.20, etc.)
        represents a stable version, while an odd number (2.17, 2.19, etc.)
        represents a development version. In the past, stable point releases
        were feature-based, coming when certain enhancements had been
        completed, or the Bugzilla development team felt that enough
        progress had been made overall. As of version 2.18, however,
        Bugzilla has moved to a time-based release schedule; current plans
        are to create a stable point release every 6 months or so after
        2.18 is deployed.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The third number in the Bugzilla version represents a bugfix version.
        Bugfix Revisions are normally released only to address security
        vulnerabilities; in the future, it is likely that the Bugzilla
        development team will back-port bugfixes in a new point release to
        the old point release for a limited period. Once enough of these
        bugfixes have accumulated (or a new security vulnerability is
        identified and closed), a bugfix release will be made. As an 
        example, 2.16.6 was a bugfix release, and improved on 2.16.5.

          should be read as a single number. It is <EM

          the same as decimal. 2.14 is newer than 2.8 because minor version
          14 is greater than minor version 8. 2.24.11 would be newer than
          2.24.9 (because bugfix 11 is greater than bugfix 9. This is
          confusing to some people who aren't used to dealing with software.

><P
>&#13;        Each of these options has its own pros and cons; the one that's
        right for you depends on how long it has been since you last
        installed, the degree to which you have customized your installation,
        and/or your network configuration. (Some discussion of the various
        methods of updating compared with degree and methods of local
        customization can be found in <A
HREF="cust-templates.html#template-method"
>Section 5.1.2</A
>.)
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The larger the jump you are trying to make, the more difficult it
        is going to be to upgrade if you have made local customizations.
        Upgrading from 2.18 to 2.18.1 should be fairly painless even if
        you are heavily customized, but going from 2.14 to 2.18 is going
        to mean a fair bit of work re-writing your local changes to use
        the new files, logic, templates, etc. If you have done no local
        changes at all, however, then upgrading should be approximately
        the same amount of work regardless of how long it has been since
        your version was released.

          is tagged in CVS.  Also, every tarball that has been distributed since
          version 2.12 has been created in such a way that it can be used with
          CVS once it is unpacked. Doing so, however, requires that you are able
          to access cvs-mirror.mozilla.org on port 2401, which may not be an
          option or a possibility for some users, especially those behind a
          highly restrictive firewall.

          and security patches that have been made since the last bugfix

          to grab this developer-made patch file than to read the patch
          notes and apply all (or even just some of) the patches oneself,
          as sometimes patches on bugs get changed before they get checked in.
