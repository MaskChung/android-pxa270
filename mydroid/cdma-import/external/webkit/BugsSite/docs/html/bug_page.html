    is a good example. Note that the labels for most fields are hyperlinks;

        Bugs are divided up by Product and Component, with a Product
        having one or more Components in it. For example,
        bugzilla.mozilla.org's "Bugzilla" Product is composed of several
        Components:

        These define exactly what state the bug is in - from not even
        being confirmed as a bug, through to being fixed and the fix
        confirmed by Quality Assurance. The different possible values for
        Status and Resolution on your installation should be documented in the
        context-sensitive help for those items.</P

>*Keywords:</EM

        The administrator can define keywords which you can use to tag and
        categorise bugs - e.g. The Mozilla Project has keywords like crash
        and regression.</P

>&#13;        <EM
>Version:</EM
>
        The "Version" field is usually used for versions of a product which
        have been released, and is set to indicate which versions of a
        Component have the particular problem the bug report is
        about.</P

>&#13;        <EM

        The bug assignee uses this field to prioritise his or her bugs.
        It's a good idea not to change this on other people's bugs.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        <EM
>Severity:</EM
>
        This indicates how severe the problem is - from blocker
        ("application unusable") to trivial ("minor cosmetic issue"). You
        can also use this field to indicate whether a bug is an enhancement
        request.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        <EM
>*Target:</EM
>
        (a.k.a. Target Milestone) A future version by which the bug is to
        be fixed. e.g. The Bugzilla Project's milestones for future
        Bugzilla versions are 2.18, 2.20, 3.0, etc. Milestones are not
        restricted to numbers, thought - you can use any text strings, such
        as dates.</P

>Attachments:</EM

          You can attach files (e.g. testcases or patches) to bugs. If there
          are any attachments, they are listed in this section.  Attachments are
          normally stored in the Bugzilla database, unless they are marked as
          Big Files, which are stored directly on disk and (unlike attachments
          kept in the database) may be deleted at some future time.

        If this bug cannot be fixed unless other bugs are fixed (depends
        on), or this bug stops other bugs being fixed (blocks), their
        numbers are recorded here.</P
