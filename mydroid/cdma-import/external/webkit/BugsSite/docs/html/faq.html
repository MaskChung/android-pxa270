            author of this FAQ), though, Bugzilla offers superior
            performance on commodity hardware, better price (free!), more
            developer-friendly features (such as stored queries, email
            integration, and platform independence), improved scalability,
            greater flexibility, and superior ease-of-use when compared
            to commercial bug-tracking software.

            It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you
            have not yet found it. While Bugzilla makes strides in usability,
            customizability, scalability, and user interface with each release,
            that doesn't mean it can't still use improvement!

>&#13;            The best way to make an enhancement request is to <A

TARGET="_top"
>file
            a bug at bugzilla.mozilla.org</A
> and set the Severity
            to 'enhancement'. Your 'request for enhancement' (RFE) will
            start out in the UNCONFIRMED state, and will stay there until
            someone with the ability to COMFIRM the bug reviews it.
            If that person feels it to be a good request that fits in with
            Bugzilla's overall direction, the status will be changed to
            NEW; if not, they will probably explain why and set the bug
            to RESOLVED/WONTFIX. If someone else has made the same (or
            almost the same) request before, your request will be marked
            RESOLVED/DUPLICATE, and a pointer to the previous RFE will be
            added.

>&#13;            Even if your RFE gets approved, that doesn't mean it's going

            number of developers, and a whole lot of RFEs... some of
            which are <EM

            code-hacking sort of person, you can help the project along
            by making a patch yourself that supports the functionality
            you require. If you have never contributed anything to

            Sybase is just NOT very standards-compliant (despite all the hype),
            and it turned out that way too much had to be changed to make it

            of the more sensible <TT

            installed an older verion of Bugzilla and created the symlink we

            Yes. However, modifying some fields, notably those related to bug

            Bugzilla can output buglists as HTML (the default), CSV or RDF.
            The link for CSV can be found at the bottom of the buglist in HTML
            format. This CSV format can easily be imported into MS Excel or
            other spreadsheet applications.

> to the URL. RDF
            is meant to be machine readable and thus it is assumed that the

            It all depends on your level of commitment. Someone with much
            Bugzilla experience can get you up and running in less than a day,
            and your Bugzilla install can run untended for years. If your
            Bugzilla strategy is critical to your business workflow, hire
            somebody to who has reasonable Perl skills, and a familiarity
            with the operating system on which Bugzilla will be running,
            and have them handle your process management, bug-tracking
            maintenance, and local customization.

            No. Bugzilla, Perl, the Template Toolkit, and all other support
            software needed to make Bugzilla work can be downloaded for free.
            MySQL -- the database used by Bugzilla -- is also open-source, but
            they ask that if you find their product valuable, you purchase a
            support contract from them that suits your needs.

            Yes! As of Bugzilla 2.18, it is a simple matter to change the
            word 'bug' into whatever word/phrase is used by your organization.
            See the documentation on Customization for more details,

            Does Bugzilla provide record locking when there is simultaneous
            access to the same bug? Does the second person get a notice
            that the bug is in use or how are they notified?
          </P
></DIV

CLASS="answer"

><B

            Bugzilla does not lock records. It provides mid-air collision
            detection -- which means that it warns a user when a commit is
            about to conflict with commits recently made by another user,
            and offers the second user a choice of options to deal with
            the conflict.

            Yes, but commits to the database must wait until the tables
            are unlocked. Bugzilla databases are typically very small,
            and backups routinely take less than a minute. If your database
            is larger, you may want to look into alternate backup
            techniques, such as database replication, or backing up from
            a read-only mirror. (Read up on these in the MySQL docs
            on the MySQL site.)

            To use the UNCONFIRMED status, you must have the 'usevotes'

            (You will have to do this for each product that wants to use
            the UNCONFIRMED state.) If you do not actually want users to be
            able to vote for bugs entered against this product, leave the

            The Bugzilla code has undergone a reasonably complete security
            audit, and user-facing CGIs run under Perl's taint mode. However, 
            it is recommended that you closely examine permissions on your
            Bugzilla installation, and follow the recommended security
            guidelines found in The Bugzilla Guide.

            The user can stop Bugzilla from sending any mail by unchecking

            (As of 2.18,this is made easier by the addition of a 'Disable
            All Mail' button.) Alternately, you can add their email address
            to the <TT

            per line). This will override their personal preferences, and

            There is no facility in Bugzilla itself to do this. It's also
            generally not a smart thing to do if you don't know exactly what
            you're doing. If you understand SQL, though, you can use the
            <B
CLASS="command"
>mysql</B
> command line utility to manually insert,
            delete and modify table information. There are also more intuitive
            GUI clients available. Personal favorites of the Bugzilla team
            are <A

            and <A

            Try running MySQL from its binary:
            <B
CLASS="command"
>mysqld --skip-grant-tables</B
>.
            This will allow you to completely rule out grant tables as the
            cause of your frustration. If this Bugzilla is able to connect
            at this point then you need to check that you have granted proper
            permission to the user password combo defined in
            <TT

            Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs.
            Synchronization will only work one way -- you can create
            a read-only copy of the database at one site, and have it
            regularly updated at intervals from the main database.
          </P
><P
>&#13;            MySQL has some synchronization features built-in to the
            latest releases. It would be great if someone looked into
            the possibilities there and provided a report to the
            newsgroup on how to effectively synchronize two Bugzilla
            installations.

>&#13;            Seriously though, making Bugzilla work easily with Windows
            was one of the major goals of the 2.18 milestone. If the
            necessary components are in place (perl, a webserver, an MTA, etc.)
            then installation of Bugzilla on a Windows box should be no more
            difficult than on any other platform. As with any installation,
            we recommend that you carefully and completely follow the
            installation instructions in <A

            Not currently. Bundle::Bugzilla enormously simplifies Bugzilla

            Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to
            configure the Web server to treat *.cgi files as CGI scripts.
            In IIS, you do this by adding *.cgi to the App Mappings with
            the &#60;path&#62;\perl.exe %s %s as the executable.

            The query page is very confusing.
            Isn't there a simpler way to query?

            The interface was simplified by a UI designer for 2.16. Further
            suggestions for improvement are welcome, but we won't sacrifice
            power for simplicity.

>&#13;            As of 2.18, there is also a 'simpler' search available. At the top
            of the search page are two links; <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Advanced Search"</SPAN
>
            will take you to the familiar full-power/full-complexity search
            page. The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Find a Specific Bug"</SPAN
> link will take you
            to a much-simplified page where you can pick a product and
            status (open,closed, or both), then enter words that appear in
            the bug you want to find. This search will scour the 'Summary'
            and 'Comment' fields, and return a list of bugs sorted so that
            the bugs with the most hits/matches are nearer to the top.

            The current behavior is acceptable to bugzilla.mozilla.org and
            most users. If you want to change this behavior, though, you
            have your choice of patches:

            These patches are all somewhat dated now, and cannot be applied

            The most likely cause is a very old browser or a browser that is
            incompatible with file upload via POST. Download the latest version

            In the Bugzilla administrator UI, edit the keyword and
            it will let you replace the old keyword name with a new one.
            This will cause a problem with the keyword cache; run
            <B

            Simple answer; you can.
          </P
><P
>&#13;            The logic behind the page checks every bug in the list to
            determine legal state changes, and then only shows you controls
            to do things that could apply to <EM
>every</EM
> bug
            on the list. The reason for this is that if you try to do something
            illegal to a bug, the whole process will grind to a halt, and all
            changes after the failed one will <EM
>also</EM
> fail.
            Since that isn't a good outcome, the page doesn't even present
            you with the option.
          </P
><P
>&#13;            In practical terms, that means that in order to mark
            multiple bugs as CLOSED, then every bug on the page has to be
            either RESOLVED or VERIFIED already; if this is not the case,
            then the option to close the bugs will not appear on the page.
          </P
><P
>&#13;            The rationale is that if you pick one of the bugs that's not
            VERIFIED and try to CLOSE it, the bug change will fail
            miserably (thus killing any changes in the list after it
            while doing the bulk change) so it doesn't even give you the
            choice.
