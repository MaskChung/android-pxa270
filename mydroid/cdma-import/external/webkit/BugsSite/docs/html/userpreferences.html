    Bugzilla via the "Edit prefs" link in the page footer.
    The preferences are split into three tabs:</P

CLASS="section"
><A
NAME="accountsettings"
>6.10.1. Account Settings</A
></H2
><P
>On this tab, you can change your basic account information,
      including your password, email address and real name. For security
      reasons, in order to change anything on this page you must type your 
      <EM
>current</EM
>
      password into the 
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Password"</SPAN
>
      field at the top of the page. 
      If you attempt to change your email address, a confirmation
      email is sent to both the old and new addresses, with a link to use to
      confirm the change. This helps to prevent account hijacking.</P

        When you enter one or more comma-delineated user accounts (usually email
        addresses) into the text entry box, you will receive a copy of all the
        bugmail those users are sent (security settings permitting).
        This powerful functionality enables seamless transitions as developers
        change projects or users go on holiday.

        allows you to do just that. The rows of the table
        define events that can happen to a bug -- things like
        attachments being added, new comments being made, the
        priority changing, etc. The columns in the table define
        your relationship with the bug:

            of the bug.

>&#13;        To fine-tune your bugmail, decide the events for which you want
        to receive bugmail; then decide if you want to receive it all
        the time (enable the checkbox for every column), or only when
        you have a certain relationship with a bug (enable the checkbox
        only for those columns). For example: if you didn't want to
        receive mail when someone added themselves to the CC list, you
        could uncheck all the boxes in the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"CC Field Changes"</SPAN
>
        line. As another example, if you never wanted to receive email
        on bugs you reported unless the bug was resolved, you would
        un-check all boxes in the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Reporter"</SPAN
> column
        except for the one on the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"The bug is resolved or
        verified"</SPAN

        from your own changes, check the box marked <SPAN
