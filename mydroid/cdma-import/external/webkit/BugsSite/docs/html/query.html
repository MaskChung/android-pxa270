    any bug report, comment, or patch currently in the Bugzilla system. You
    can play with it here:

>The Search page has controls for selecting different possible
    values for all of the fields in a bug, as described above. For some
    fields, multiple values can be selected. In those cases, Bugzilla
    returns bugs where the content of the field matches any one of the selected
    values. If none is selected, then the field can take any value.</P

>&#13;        The boolean charts further restrict the set of results
        returned by a query. It is possible to search for bugs
        based on elaborate combinations of critera.

>&#13;        The simplest boolean searches have only one term. These searches
        permit the selected left <EM

        to be compared using a
        selectable <EM
>operator</EM
> to a
        specified <EM

        Using the "And," "Or," and "Add Another Boolean Chart" buttons, 
        additonal terms can be included in the query, further
        altering the list of bugs returned by the query.

>&#13;          Sometimes, a query needs to compare a field containing
          a user's ID (such as ReportedBy) with 
          a user's ID (such as the user running the query or the user
          to whom each bug is assigned). When the operator is either 
          "equals" or "notequals", the value can be "%reporter%", 
          "%assignee%", "%qacontact%", or "%user%."  The user pronoun
          referes to the user who is executing the query or, in the case
          of whining reports, the user who will be the recipient
          of the report. The reporter, assignee, and qacontact
          pronouns refer to the corresponding fields in the bug.

          would find every bug where there was nobody on the CC list who
          did contain the string. Similarly, the use of negation also permits
          complex expressions to be built using terms OR'd together and then
          negated. Negation permits queries such as

>&#13;          The terms within a single row of a boolean chart are all
          constraints on a single piece of data. If you are looking for
          a bug that has two different people cc'd on it, then you need 
          to use two boolean charts. A search for

          would return only bugs with "foo@mozilla.org" on the cc list.
          If you wanted bugs where there is someone on the cc list
          containing "foo@" and someone else containing "@mozilla.org",
          then you would need two boolean charts.
