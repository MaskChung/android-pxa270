>&#13;        If you want to edit Bugzilla's templates, the first decision
        you must make is how you want to go about doing so. There are two
        choices, and which you use depends mainly on the scope of your 
        modifications, and the method you plan to use to upgrade Bugzilla.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The first method of making customizations is to directly edit the
        templates found in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template/en/default</TT
>.
        This is probably the best way to go about it if you are going to
        be upgrading Bugzilla through CVS, because if you then execute
        a <B
CLASS="command"
>cvs update</B
>, any changes you have made will
        be merged automagically with the updated versions.

        directory structure automatically override any identically-named

>&#13;        The second method of customization should be used if you 
        use the overwriting method of upgrade, because otherwise 
        your changes will be lost.  This method may also be better if
        you are using the CVS method of upgrading and are going to make major
        changes, because it is guaranteed that the contents of this directory
        will not be touched during an upgrade, and you can then decide whether
        to continue using your own templates, or make the effort to merge your
        changes into the new versions by hand.

>&#13;        Using this method, your installation may break if incompatible
        changes are made to the template interface.  Such changes should
        be documented in the release notes, provided you are using a
        stable release of Bugzilla.  If you use using unstable code, you will
        need to deal with this one yourself, although if possible the changes
        will be mentioned before they occur in the deprecations section of the
        previous stable release's release notes.

>&#13;          If you are making template changes that you intend on submitting back

>&#13;        The syntax of the Template Toolkit language is beyond the scope of

      </P
><P
>&#13;        One thing you should take particular care about is the need
        to properly HTML filter data that has been passed into the template.
        This means that if the data can possibly contain special HTML characters
        such as &#60;, and the data was not intended to be HTML, they need to be
        converted to entity form, i.e. &#38;lt;.  You use the 'html' filter in the
        Template Toolkit to do this.  If you forget, you may open up
        your installation to cross-site scripting attacks.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Also note that Bugzilla adds a few filters of its own, that are not
        in standard Template Toolkit.  In particular, the 'url_quote' filter
        can convert characters that are illegal or have special meaning in URLs,
        such as &#38;, to the encoded form, i.e. %26.  This actually encodes most
        characters (but not the common ones such as letters and numbers and so
        on), including the HTML-special characters, so there's never a need to
        HTML filter afterwards.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Editing templates is a good way of doing a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"poor man's custom
        fields"</SPAN
>.
        For example, if you don't use the Status Whiteboard, but want to have
        a free-form text entry box for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Build Identifier"</SPAN
>,
        then you can just
        edit the templates to change the field labels. It's still be called
        status_whiteboard internally, but your users don't need to know that.

>&#13;        Some CGI's have the ability to use more than one template. For example,
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>buglist.cgi</TT
> can output itself as RDF, or as two 
        formats of HTML (complex and simple). The mechanism that provides this 
        feature is extensible.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Bugzilla can support different types of output, which again can have 
        multiple formats. In order to request a certain type, you can append 
        the &#38;ctype=&#60;contenttype&#62; (such as rdf or html) to the 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>&#60;cginame&#62;.cgi</TT
> URL. If you would like to 
        retrieve a certain format, you can use the &#38;format=&#60;format&#62; 
        (such as simple or complex) in the URL.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        To see if a CGI supports multiple output formats and types, grep the
        CGI for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"GetFormat"</SPAN

        multiple format/type support isn't too hard - see how it's done in
        other CGIs, e.g. config.cgi.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        To make a new format template for a CGI which supports this, 
        open a current template for
        that CGI and take note of the INTERFACE comment (if present.) This 
        comment defines what variables are passed into this template. If 
        there isn't one, I'm afraid you'll have to read the template and
        the code to find out what information you get.

> file in the 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"

        constant. If your content type is not there, add it. Remember
        the three- or four-letter tag assigned to your content type.

>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>global/header.html.tmpl</B

        This defines the header that goes on all Bugzilla pages.
        The header includes the banner, which is what appears to users
        and is probably what you want to edit instead.  However the
        header also includes the HTML HEAD section, so you could for
        example add a stylesheet or META tag by editing the header.
      </P

        This contains the <SPAN

        that appears
        at the top of all Bugzilla pages.  The default banner is reasonably
        barren, so you'll probably want to customize this to give your
        installation a distinctive look and feel.  It is recommended you
        preserve the Bugzilla version number in some form so the version 
        you are running can be determined, and users know what docs to read.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"

        This defines the footer that goes on all Bugzilla pages.  Editing

        This template controls the appearance of the bug lists created

        the width and title of a column, the maximum display length of
        each entry, and the wrap behaviour of long entries.
        For long bug lists, Bugzilla inserts a 'break' every 100 bugs by
        default; this behaviour is also controlled by this template, and
        that value can be modified here.

        overwrite those changes or go back and revisit the bug.  The default
        title and header on this page read "Mid-air collision detected!"  If
        you work in the aviation industry, or other environment where this
        might be found offensive (yes, we have true stories of this happening)

        You may not wish to go to the effort of creating custom fields in
        Bugzilla, yet you want to make sure that each bug report contains
        a number of pieces of important information for which there is not
        a special field. The bug entry system has been designed in an
        extensible fashion to enable you to add arbitrary HTML widgets,
        such as drop-down lists or textboxes, to the bug entry page
        and have their values appear formatted in the initial comment.
        A hidden field that indicates the format should be added inside
        the form in order to make the template functional. Its value should
        be the suffix of the template filename. For example, if the file
        is called <TT
CLASS="filename"
>create-cust.html.tmpl</TT
>, then
        <TABLE

>&#13;        So to use this feature, create a custom template for

        could base it, is 
        <TT

        Call it <TT
CLASS="filename"
>create-&#60;formatname&#62;.html.tmpl</TT

        in it, add widgets for each piece of information you'd like
        collected - such as a build number, or set of steps to reproduce.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Then, create a template like 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>custom/bug/create/comment.txt.tmpl</TT
>, and call it 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>comment-&#60;formatname&#62;.txt.tmpl</TT
>. This 
        template should reference the form fields you have created using

>Bugzilla honours the user's Accept: HTTP header. You can install
      templates in other languages, and Bugzilla will pick the most appropriate
      according to a priority order defined by you. Many
      language templates can be obtained from <A
HREF="http://www.bugzilla.org/download.html#localizations"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.bugzilla.org/download.html#localizations</A
>. Instructions
      for submitting new languages are also available from that location.
      </P
><P
>After untarring the localizations (or creating your own) in the 
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>BUGZILLA_ROOT/template</TT
> directory,
      you must update the <VAR
CLASS="option"
>languages</VAR
> parameter to contain any
      localizations you'd like to permit. You may also wish to set the
      <VAR
CLASS="option"
>defaultlanguage</VAR
> parameter to something other than
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"en"</SPAN
> if you don't want Engish to be the default language.
