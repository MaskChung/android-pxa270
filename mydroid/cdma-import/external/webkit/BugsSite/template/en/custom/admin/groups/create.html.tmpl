<p><b>Name</b> is what is used with the UserInGroup() function in any
customized cgi files you write that use a given group.  It can also be used
by people submitting [% terms.bugs %] by email to limit [% terms.abug %] to
a certain set of groups. It may not contain any spaces.</p>

<p><b>Description</b> is what will be shown in the [% terms.bug %] reports
to members of the group where they can choose whether
the [% terms.bug %] will be restricted to others in the same group.</p>

<p>The <b>Use For [% terms.Bugs %]</b> flag determines whether or not the
group is eligible to be used for [% terms.bugs %]. If you clear this, it will
no longer be possible for users to add [% terms.bugs %] to this group,
although [% terms.bugs %] already in the group will remain in the group.
Doing so is a much less drastic way to stop a group from growing
than deleting the group would be. <b>Note: If you are creating
a group, you probably want it to be usable for [% terms.bugs %], in which
case you should leave this checked.</b></p>

<p><b>User RegExp</b> is optional, and if filled in, will 
automatically grant membership to this group to anyone with an 
email address that matches this regular expression.</p>

<p>By default, the new group will be associated with existing 
products. Unchecking the "Insert new group into all existing 
products" option will prevent this and make the group become 
visible only when its controls have been added to a product.</p>
