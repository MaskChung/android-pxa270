These settings control the relationship of the groups to this
product.
<p>
If any group has <b>Entry</b> selected, then this product will
restrict [% terms.bug %] entry to only those users who are members of all the
groups with entry selected.
<p>
If any group has <b>Canedit</b> selected, then this product
will be read-only for any users who are not members of all of
the groups with Canedit selected. ONLY users who are members of
all the canedit groups will be able to edit. This is an additional
restriction that further restricts what can be edited by a user.
<p>
The <b>MemberControl</b> and <b>OtherControl</b> fields
indicate which [% terms.bugs %] will be placed in
this group according to the following definitions.
