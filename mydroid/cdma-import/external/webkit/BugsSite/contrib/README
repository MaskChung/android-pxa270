This directory includes:

    bugzilla-submit/ --  A standalone bug submission program.

   mysqld-watcher.pl --  This script can be installed as a frequent cron 
                         job to clean up stalled/dead queries.

       sendbugmail.pl -- This script is a drop-in replacement for the
                         'processmail' script which used to be shipped
                         with Bugzilla, but was replaced by the
                         Bugzilla/BugMail.pm Perl module.  You can use
                         this script if you were previously calling
                         processmail from other scripts external to
                         Bugzilla.  See the comments at the top of
                         the file for usage information.  Contributed
