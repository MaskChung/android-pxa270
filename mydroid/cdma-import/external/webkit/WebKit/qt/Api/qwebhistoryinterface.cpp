  \since 4.4
  \brief The QWebHistoryInterface class provides an interface to implement link history.

  The QWebHistoryInterface is an interface that can be used to
  implement link history. It contains two pure virtual methods that
  are called by the WebKit engine.  addHistoryEntry() is used to add
  pages that have been visited to the interface, while
  historyContains() is used to query whether this page has been
  visited by the user.
