<h2>Getting a Useful Crash Log</h2>
<p>Crash logs are incredibly useful when trying to track down a bug, especially if it's not immediately reproducible.</p>

<div class="mac-instructions" id="mac">
    <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
    <p>Obtaining a crash log on Mac OS X is incredibly easy since it automatically creates easily accessible crash logs for you.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>If WebKit has just crashed or you can easily reproduce the crash, press the Report button on the CrashReporter dialog box
            to view the crash information.</p>
            <img src="mac_reportbox.jpg" alt="Mac OS X Crash report box">
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Copy and paste the entire contents of the top portion of the CrashReporter window into your favorite text editor and
            upload it as an attachment in Bugzilla.</p>
            <img src="mac_viewtrace.jpg" alt="Mac OS X Crash log">
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If the crash report dialog does not appear or the crash is hard to reproduce, you can get the crash log from the
            <tt>Safari.crash.log</tt> file located in <tt>~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/</tt>. This file is a plain text file and can
            be viewed in the default Console.app or your favorite text editor.</p>

            <p><strong>All</strong> of Safari's crashes are logged to this file so please only attach the last crash in it.
                Crashes are separated by a series of asterisks (&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;)
                for easy identification.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="windows-instructions" id="win">
    <h4>Windows XP</h4>
    <p>Windows XP does not automatically log crashes like OS X, but it does include Dr. Watson, an easy to set up tool that can be
        configured to log them.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>In the Start menu's Run box or from a DOS or Cygwin prompt, enter the command <tt>drwtsn32 -i</tt>.</p>
            <img src="win_installwatson.jpg" alt="Dr Watson install command">
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>A dialog box will appear informing you that Dr. Watson has been installed as the default debugger. Press OK.</p>
            <img src="win_watsoninstalled.jpg" alt="Dr Watson was installed box">
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Crash information will now be logged to the <tt>user.dmp</tt> file in
            <tt>C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Dr Watson\</tt>.</p>

            <p>Dr. Watson will create a <tt>user.dmp</tt> file that records what WebKit was doing when it crashed.
                Be careful as it is overwritten with every crash.</p>

            <p>When reporting a WebKit bug, please upload the <tt>user.dmp</tt> file if possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Running <tt>drwtsn32</tt> without any options or switches will bring up a window that allows you to change various
                setting such as moving the log folder to a more easily accessible location or throwing a visual alert letting
                you know it caught the crash.</p>
            <img src="win_watsongui.jpg" alt="Dr Watson window">
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Windows Vista</h4>
    <p>Windows Vista does not include Dr. Watson. Instead, Windows Error Reporting (WER) has been integrated into the operating system.
       By default, Vista uploads the crash logs to Microsoft, but does not save a local copy. This is configurable via the registry.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Save the following text to a file named <tt>wer.reg</tt>:</p><tt style="white-space:pre">Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting]
"ForceQueue"=dword:00000001
</tt>
        </li>
        <li><p>Double-click the file from Windows Explorer and respond affirmatively to any prompts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Reboot</p></li>        
    </ol>
    <p>
        The next time Safari (or any other application) crashes, the crash information will be written into a folder located inside <tt>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportQueue</tt>.
        Check the modification date to make sure you are using the correct file.
    </p>
    <p>Be sure to include the following files in your bug report:</p>
    <dl style="margin-left:2em">
        <dt><tt>WER<em>xxxx</em>.tmp.mdmp</tt></dt>
        <dd>This is the most important file. It contains the crash dump that can be opened inside Visual Studio or other Windows debuggers.</dd>
        <dt><tt>WER<em>xxxx</em>.tmp.version.txt</tt></dt>
        <dd>Contains the operating system version and other hardware information.</dd>
        <dt><tt>WER<em>xxxx</em>.tmp.appcompat.txt</tt></dt>
        <dd>Lists all of the DLLs loaded at the time of the crash with their version information.</dd>
    </dl>
