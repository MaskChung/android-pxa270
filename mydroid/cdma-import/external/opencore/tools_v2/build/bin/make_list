# IMPORTANT For the make to exit immediately upon
#           encountering an error, this function
#           should be called at the very end
#           The exit status of this function then
#           becomes the exit status of this shell
#           script. This allows makefiles calling
#           this script to exit upon finding a
#           non-zero exit status.
