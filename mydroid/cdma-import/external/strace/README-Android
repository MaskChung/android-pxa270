Steps to build from original source:

1) apply arm-eabi.patch from Debian bug tracker

2) run configure as follows
./configure CFLAGS=-I/android/device/system/kernel_headers/ ./configure  --prefix=/data/ --build=arm-unknown-linux-gnu

(note this uses the desktop gcc and glibc headers)

3) Further modifications as change history will show
