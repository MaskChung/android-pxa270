Need to add NOOP checking to Pop3Store and ImapStore on cached connections.

Move attachments to files, instead of storing as blobs in the database. There are tons of ways
we can make the app perform better with this small change. Primarily, we can do everything
pertaining to large attachments as streams instead of as large loads into byte arrays.

Get rid of the LocalStore's attachment to Store altogether. Local storage is too complex and
specific to performance to be bound to the Store API. It needs to be flexible with plenty of helper
functions to make best use of memory and resources.

Make better use of the abstractions for Body, Part and BodyPart. Proper use of these abstractions
can completely remove the need for the special headers.
