 * It returns points along the boundary of the Shape 
 * which may be actual vertices (in the case of a shape made of line 
 * segments) or may be points on a curved segment with the distance 
 * between the points determined by a chosen flattening factor. 
 * <p>
 * If the shape is closed, the outline is traversed in the counter-clockwise 
 * direction. That means that moving forward along the boundary is to travel 
 * in such a way that the interior of the shape is to the left of the 
 * outline path and the exterior of the shape is to the right of the outline
 * path. The interior and exterior of the shape are determined by a 
 * winding rule.
