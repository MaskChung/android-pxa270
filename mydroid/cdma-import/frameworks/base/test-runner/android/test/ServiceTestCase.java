/**
 * This test case provides a framework in which you can test Service classes in
 * a controlled environment.  It provides basic support for the lifecycle of a
 * Service, and hooks by which you can inject various dependencies and control
 * the environment in which your Service is tested.
 *
 * <p><b>Lifecycle Support.</b>
 * Every Service is designed to be accessed within a specific sequence of
 * calls.  <insert link to Service lifecycle doc here>. 
 * In order to support the lifecycle of a Service, this test case will make the
 * following calls at the following times.
 *
 * <ul><li>The test case will not call onCreate() until your test calls 
 * {@link #startService} or {@link #bindService}.  This gives you a chance
 * to set up or adjust any additional framework or test logic before
 * onCreate().</li>
 * <li>When your test calls {@link #startService} or {@link #bindService}
 * the test case will call onCreate(), and then call the corresponding entry point in your service.
 * It will record any parameters or other support values necessary to support the lifecycle.</li>
 * <li>After your test completes, the test case {@link #tearDown} function is
 * automatically called, and it will stop & destroy your service with the appropriate
 * calls (depending on how your test invoked the service.)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>Dependency Injection.</b>
 * Every service has two inherent dependencies, the {@link android.content.Context Context} in
 * which it runs, and the {@link android.app.Application Application} with which it is associated.
 * This framework allows you to inject modified, mock, or isolated replacements for these 
 * dependencies, and thus perform a true unit test.
 * 
 * <p>If simply run your tests as-is, your Service will be injected with a fully-functional
 * Context, and a generic {@link android.test.mock.MockApplication MockApplication} object.
 * You can create and inject alternatives to either of these by calling 
 * {@link AndroidTestCase#setContext(Context) setContext()} or 
 * {@link #setApplication setApplication()}.  You must do this <i>before</i> calling
 * startService() or bindService().  The test framework provides a
 * number of alternatives for Context, including {link android.test.mock.MockContext MockContext}, 
 * {@link android.test.RenamingDelegatingContext RenamingDelegatingContext}, and 
 * {@link android.content.ContextWrapper ContextWrapper}.
