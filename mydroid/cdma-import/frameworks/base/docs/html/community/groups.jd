			<h3>Android Discussion Groups</h3>			
			<p>Welcome to the Android community! We're glad you're here and invite you to participate in these discussions. Before posting, please red the <a href="#">Groups Charter</a> that covers the community guidelines.</p>
			<p>To get the most out of this group, please do the following before you post:</p>
			<div class="indent">
				<p><strong>1.</strong> <a href="community_2.html">Read the FAQs</a> The most common questions are addressed in this frequently updated list.</p>
				<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Type in keywords of your questions in the main Android site's search bar</strong> (such as the one above). This search encompasses all previous discussions, across all groups, as well as the full contents of the site, documentation, and blogs. Chances are good that somebody has run into the same issue before.</li>
				<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Be very clear</strong> about your question in the subject - it helps everyone, both those trying to answer your question as well as those who may be looking for information in the future. Also <strong>give plenty of details</strong> in your post to help others understand your problem. Code or log snippets, as well as pointers to screenshots, may also be helpful.
				</p>
