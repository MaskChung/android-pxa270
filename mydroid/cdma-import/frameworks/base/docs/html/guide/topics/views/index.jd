@jd:body

<p>To build a user interface fors your Android application, you work with <em>views</em> and <em>viewgroups</em> -- basic units of user interface expression on the Android platform. All views and viewgroups are descendants of the class {@link android.view.View}. To help you build your UI more quickly, Android provides a set of fully implemented views and viewgroups &mdash; called widgets and layouts &mdash; that you can use. 

The topics below describe the basics of how you use views to implement a user interface. including the types of screen elements available, the ways that you can declare them in your application, how you can bind a screen elements to local data, and how views can catch and handle screen or keypad events. </p>

<p>For a quick start on how to create the Views you need for your UI, check out the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/tutorials/views/hello-views-index.html">Hello Views tutorials</a>. You can look at a variety of available layouts and screen elements as they would be rendered on a device, then look at the code for declaring and invoking each one. </p>

<p>You can find additional sample code in the API Demos application, included in the SDK's samples directory. </p>
