<h1>Developing Android Applications</h1>
<p>You can develop Android applications with the same high-quality tools you
use to develop Java applications. The Android core libraries provide the
functionality needed to build some amazingly rich mobile applications, and
the Android development tools make running, debugging, and testing your
applications a snap.</p>

<p>This section explains the ins and outs of developing Android
applications. It outlines the philosophy
behind the system and then describes each of the
key subsystems in detail. After reading this section, you'll have the knowledge
and confidence to begin writing that real-world Android app you have in
mind.</p>

<p>Before reading this section you should read the <a
href="{@docRoot}intro/index.html">Getting Started Guide</a>, which helps you get
up and running with the Android SDK and shows you how to build a basic
app. This section builds on the information in the Getting Started
section.</p>

<p>Here's the content you'll find in this section:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><a href="{@docRoot}devel/implementing-ui.html">Implementing a UI</a></dt>
    <dd>Explains how to construct and interact with user interfaces for Android
        applications. After reading this page you'll have a solid understanding of
        how Android layouts are built, how they operate at runtime, and how you can
        make them pretty.</dd>
    <dt><a href="{@docRoot}devel/building-blocks.html">Building Blocks</a></dt>
    <dd>Detailed descriptions of Android components. Covers the ins and outs
        of the components summarized in Anatomy of an Android App, plus more. This
        section goes into detail on each of the key Android components (Intents,
        Activities, Views, and events.)</dd>
    <dt><a href="{@docRoot}devel/data.html">Storing and Retrieving Data</a></dt>
    <dd>How to read and write data to the various storage mechanisms
        provided by Android, and to network services. There are several
        different ways to read and write data from an Android application,
        each aimed at different needs. This page describes them all and
        explains how to pick the right one for your needs.</dd>
    <dt><a href="{@docRoot}devel/security.html">Security Model</a></dt>
    <dd>Gaining access to secure system resources and features, and
        declaring permissions to control access to your own secure features.
        Permissions control whether a given application is able to access
        piece of functionality provided by another application (for example,
        which applications can dial the phone). This page describes how
        permissions work and how to request permissions as well as define your
        own.</dd>
    <dt><a href="{@docRoot}devel/resources-i18n.html">Resources and i18n</a></dt>
    <dd>Detailed descriptions of Android's application-resource management
        system, including how it's used for internationalization and
        localization. "Resources" are application assets (such as images,
        localized strings, and XML layouts) that need to be resolved at
        runtime. This page describes how Android resolves which resource to
        load from a selection of them, as well as how to create and use
        resources.</dd>
