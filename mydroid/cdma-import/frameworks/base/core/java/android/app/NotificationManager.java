/**
 * Class to notify the user of events that happen.  This is how you tell
 * the user that something has happened in the background. {@more}
 *
 * Notifications can take different forms:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>A persistent icon that goes in the status bar and is accessible
 *          through the launcher, (when the user selects it, a designated Intent
 *          can be launched),</li>
 *      <li>Turning on or flashing LEDs on the device, or</li>
 *      <li>Alerting the user by flashing the backlight, playing a sound,
 *          or vibrating.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each of the notify methods takes an int id parameter.  This id identifies
 * this notification from your app to the system, so that id should be unique
 * within your app.  If you call one of the notify methods with an id that is
 * currently active and a new set of notification parameters, it will be
 * updated.  For example, if you pass a new status bar icon, the old icon in
 * the status bar will be replaced with the new one.  This is also the same
 * id you pass to the {@link #cancel} method to clear this notification.
 *
 * <p>
 * You do not instantiate this class directly; instead, retrieve it through
 * {@link android.content.Context#getSystemService}.
 *
 * @see android.app.Notification
 * @see android.content.Context#getSystemService
