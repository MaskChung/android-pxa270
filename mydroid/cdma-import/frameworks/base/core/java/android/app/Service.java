/**
 * A Service is an application component that runs in the background, not
 * interacting with the user, for an indefinite period of time.  Each service
 * class must have a corresponding
 * {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestService &lt;service&gt;}
 * declaration in its package's <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>.  Services
 * can be started with
 * {@link android.content.Context#startService Context.startService()} and
 * {@link android.content.Context#bindService Context.bindService()}.
 * 
 * <p>Note that services, like other application objects, run in the main
 * thread of their hosting process.  This means that, if your service is going
 * to do any CPU intensive (such as MP3 playback) or blocking (such as
 * networking) operations, it should spawn its own thread in which to do that
 * work.  More information on this can be found in the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}intro/appmodel.html#Threads">Threading section of the
 * Application Model overview</a>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The Service class is an important part of an
 * <a href="{@docRoot}intro/lifecycle.html">application's overall lifecycle</a>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Topics covered here:
 * <ol>
 * <li><a href="#ServiceLifecycle">Service Lifecycle</a>
 * <li><a href="#Permissions">Permissions</a>
 * <li><a href="#ProcessLifecycle">Process Lifecycle</a>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <a name="ServiceLifecycle"></a>
 * <h3>Service Lifecycle</h3>
 * 
 * <p>There are two reasons that a service can be run by the system.  If someone
 * calls {@link android.content.Context#startService Context.startService()} then the system will
 * retrieve the service (creating it and calling its {@link #onCreate} method
 * if needed) and then call its {@link #onStart} method with the
 * arguments supplied by the client.  The service will at this point continue
 * running until {@link android.content.Context#stopService Context.stopService()} or
 * {@link #stopSelf()} is called.  Note that multiple calls to
 * Context.startService() do not nest (though they do result in multiple corresponding
 * calls to onStart()), so no matter how many times it is started a service
 * will be stopped once Context.stopService() or stopSelf() is called.
 * 
 * <p>Clients can also use {@link android.content.Context#bindService Context.bindService()} to
 * obtain a persistent connection to a service.  This likewise creates the
 * service if it is not already running (calling {@link #onCreate} while
 * doing so), but does not call onStart().  The client will receive the
 * {@link android.os.IBinder} object that the service returns from its
 * {@link #onBind} method, allowing the client to then make calls back
 * to the service.  The service will remain running as long as the connection
 * is established (whether or not the client retains a reference on the
 * service's IBinder).  Usually the IBinder returned is for a complex
 * interface that has been <a href="{@docRoot}reference/aidl.html">written
 * in aidl</a>.
 * 
 * <p>A service can be both started and have connections bound to it.  In such
 * a case, the system will keep the service running as long as either it is
 * started <em>or</em> there are one or more connections to it with the
 * {@link android.content.Context#BIND_AUTO_CREATE Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE}
 * flag.  Once neither
 * of these situations hold, the service's {@link #onDestroy} method is called
 * and the service is effectively terminated.  All cleanup (stopping threads,
 * unregistering receivers) should be complete upon returning from onDestroy().
 * 
 * <a name="Permissions"></a>
 * <h3>Permissions</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Global access to a service can be enforced when it is declared in its
 * manifest's {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestService &lt;service&gt;}
 * tag.  By doing so, other applications will need to declare a corresponding
 * {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestUsesPermission &lt;uses-permission&gt;}
 * element in their own manifest to be able to start, stop, or bind to
 * the service.
 * 
 * <p>In addition, a service can protect individual IPC calls into it with
 * permissions, by calling the
 * {@link #checkCallingPermission}
 * method before executing the implementation of that call.
 * 
 * <p>See the <a href="{@docRoot}devel/security.html">Security Model</a>
 * document for more information on permissions and security in general.
 * 
 * <a name="ProcessLifecycle"></a>
 * <h3>Process Lifecycle</h3>
 * 
 * <p>The Android system will attempt to keep the process hosting a service
 * around as long as the service has been started or has clients bound to it.
 * When running low on memory and needing to kill existing processes, the
 * priority of a process hosting the service will be the higher of the
 * following possibilities:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><p>If the service is currently executing code in its
 * {@link #onCreate onCreate()}, {@link #onStart onStart()},
 * or {@link #onDestroy onDestroy()} methods, then the hosting process will
 * be a foreground process to ensure this code can execute without
 * being killed.
 * <li><p>If the service has been started, then its hosting process is considered
 * to be less important than any processes that are currently visible to the
 * user on-screen, but more important than any process not visible.  Because
 * only a few processes are generally visible to the user, this means that
 * the service should not be killed except in extreme low memory conditions.
 * <li><p>If there are clients bound to the service, then the service's hosting
 * process is never less important than the most important client.  That is,
 * if one of its clients is visible to the user, then the service itself is
 * considered to be visible.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Note this means that most of the time your service is running, it may
 * be killed by the system if it is under heavy memory pressure.  If this
 * happens, the system will later try to restart the service.  An important
 * consequence of this is that if you implement {@link #onStart onStart()}
 * to schedule work to be done asynchronously or in another thread, then you
 * may want to write information about that work into persistent storage
 * during the onStart() call so that it does not get lost if the service later
 * gets killed.
 * 
 * <p>Other application components running in the same process as the service
 * (such as an {@link android.app.Activity}) can, of course, increase the
 * importance of the overall
 * process beyond just the importance of the service itself.
