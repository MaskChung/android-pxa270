/**
 * Takes care of the grunt work of maintaining a list of remote interfaces,
 * typically for the use of performing callbacks from a
 * {@link android.app.Service} to its clients.  In particular, this:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> Keeps track of a set of registered {@link IInterface} callbacks,
 * taking care to identify them through their underlying unique {@link IBinder}
 * (by calling {@link IInterface#asBinder IInterface.asBinder()}.
 * <li> Attaches a {@link IBinder.DeathRecipient IBinder.DeathRecipient} to
 * each registered interface, so that it can be cleaned out of the list if its
 * process goes away.
 * <li> Performs locking of the underlying list of interfaces to deal with
 * multithreaded incoming calls, and a thread-safe way to iterate over a
 * snapshot of the list without holding its lock.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>To use this class, simply create a single instance along with your
 * service, and call its {@link #register} and {@link #unregister} methods
 * as client register and unregister with your service.  To call back on to
 * the registered clients, use {@link #beginBroadcast},
 * {@link #getBroadcastItem}, and {@link #finishBroadcast}.
 * 
 * <p>If a registered callback's process goes away, this class will take
 * care of automatically removing it from the list.  If you want to do
 * additional work in this situation, you can create a subclass that
 * implements the {@link #onCallbackDied} method.
