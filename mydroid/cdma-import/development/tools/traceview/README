Using the Eclipse projects for traceview.

traceview requires SWT to compile.

SWT is available in the depot under //device/prebuild/<platform>/swt

Because the build path cannot contain relative path that are not inside the project directory,
the .classpath file references a user library called ANDROID_SWT.

In order to compile the project, make a user library called ANDROID_SWT containing the jar
available at //device/prebuild/<platform>/swt.
